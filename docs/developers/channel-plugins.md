# Channel Plugin Developer Guide

A channel plugin connects Qwen Code to a messaging platform. It's packaged as an [extension](../users/extension/introduction) and loaded at startup. For user-facing docs on installing and configuring plugins, see [Plugins](../users/features/channels/plugins).

## How It Fits Together

Your plugin sits in the Platform Adapter layer. You handle platform-specific concerns (connecting, receiving messages, sending responses). `ChannelBase` handles everything else (access control, session routing, prompt queuing, slash commands, crash recovery).

```
Your Plugin  →  builds Envelope  →  handleInbound()
ChannelBase  →  gates → commands → routing → ChannelAgentBridge.prompt()
ChannelBase  →  calls your sendMessage() with the agent's response
```

`ChannelAgentBridge` is the adapter-facing bridge contract. The current standalone `qwen channel start` path provides an `AcpBridge`, but plugin code should type constructor parameters as `ChannelAgentBridge` so the same adapter can run behind other bridge implementations later.

Migration note for existing TypeScript plugins: if your adapter constructor or factory explicitly types `bridge` as `AcpBridge`, change that annotation to `ChannelAgentBridge` and keep using only the methods exposed by that contract. JavaScript plugins are unaffected at runtime, and standalone `qwen channel start` still passes the current `AcpBridge` implementation.

## Runtime Modes

The same plugin adapter can be hosted by either channel runtime:

- `qwen channel start [name]` is the standalone ACP-backed service. It still uses `AcpBridge` and remains the stable command for running channels outside a daemon.
- `qwen serve --channel <name>` and repeatable `--channel` flags start experimental daemon-managed channel workers. Named channels are grouped by owning workspace, with one worker per owning runtime. `--channel all` intentionally starts only the primary workspace's configured channels. Workers are owned by `qwen serve`, connect to that daemon through the SDK, and pass adapters a `ChannelAgentBridge` facade backed by `DaemonChannelBridge`.

Daemon-managed channels inherit the daemon's lifecycle and status reporting. They are intentionally out-of-process so adapter or platform SDK failures do not crash the daemon. Every named channel must resolve to exactly one registered, trusted workspace; its worker receives that runtime's canonical cwd and environment overlay. A user/system channel with no cwd is ambiguous when several workspaces are registered, while a channel in a workspace-local settings file belongs to that workspace by default. `--channel all` remains primary-only and cannot be combined with named selections.

## The Plugin Object

Your extension entry point exports a `plugin` conforming to `ChannelPlugin`:

```typescript
import type { ChannelPlugin } from '@qwen-code/channel-base';
import { MyChannel } from './MyChannel.js';

export const plugin: ChannelPlugin = {
  channelType: 'my-platform', // Unique ID, used in settings.json "type" field
  displayName: 'My Platform', // Shown in CLI output
  requiredConfigFields: ['apiKey'], // Validated at startup (beyond standard ChannelConfig)
  createChannel: (name, config, bridge, options) =>
    new MyChannel(name, config, bridge, options),
};
```

## The Channel Adapter

Extend `ChannelBase` and implement three methods:

```typescript
import { ChannelBase } from '@qwen-code/channel-base';
import type {
  ChannelBaseOptions,
  ChannelAgentBridge,
  ChannelConfig,
  Envelope,
  SessionTarget,
} from '@qwen-code/channel-base';

export class MyChannel extends ChannelBase {
  constructor(
    name: string,
    config: ChannelConfig,
    bridge: ChannelAgentBridge,
    options?: ChannelBaseOptions,
  ) {
    super(name, config, bridge, options);
  }

  async connect(): Promise<void> {
    // Connect to your platform, register message handlers
    // When a message arrives:
    const envelope: Envelope = {
      channelName: this.name,
      senderId: '...', // Stable, unique platform user ID
      senderName: '...', // Display name
      chatId: '...', // Chat/conversation ID (distinct for DMs vs groups)
      text: '...', // Message text (strip @mentions)
      isGroup: false, // Accurate — used by GroupGate
      isMentioned: false, // Accurate — used by GroupGate
      isReplyToBot: false, // Accurate — used by GroupGate
    };
    this.handleInbound(envelope);
  }

  async sendMessage(chatId: string, text: string): Promise<void> {
    // Format markdown → platform format, chunk if needed, deliver
  }

  disconnect(): void {
    // Clean up connections
  }
}
```

Most adapters should pass `options` through unchanged. If an adapter creates its own `SessionRouter` and passes that router to `super()`, set `registerBridgeEvents: true` in `ChannelBaseOptions` so `ChannelBase` still receives `toolCall` and `sessionDied` events directly. Leave it unset for routers supplied by the channel gateway.

If your adapter exposes shell-command or BTW side-question behavior, check that the corresponding `bridge.shellCommand` / `bridge.btw` method exists before enabling it. Daemon-managed workers omit those optional methods unless the daemon advertises the matching `session_shell_command` / `session_btw` capability.

## The Envelope

The normalized message object you build from platform data. The boolean flags drive gate logic, so they must be accurate.

| Field            | Type         | Required | Notes                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `channelName`    | string       | Yes      | Use `this.name`                                                            |
| `senderId`       | string       | Yes      | Must be stable across messages (used for session routing + access control) |
| `senderName`     | string       | Yes      | Display name                                                               |
| `chatId`         | string       | Yes      | Must distinguish DMs from groups                                           |
| `chatName`       | string       | No       | Group/conversation name when supplied by the platform                      |
| `text`           | string       | Yes      | Strip bot @mentions                                                        |
| `threadId`       | string       | No       | For `sessionScope: "thread"`                                               |
| `messageId`      | string       | No       | Platform message ID — useful for response correlation                      |
| `isGroup`        | boolean      | Yes      | GroupGate relies on this                                                   |
| `isMentioned`    | boolean      | Yes      | GroupGate relies on this                                                   |
| `isReplyToBot`   | boolean      | Yes      | GroupGate relies on this                                                   |
| `referencedText` | string       | No       | Quoted message — prepended as context                                      |
| `imageBase64`    | string       | No       | Base64-encoded image (legacy — prefer `attachments`)                       |
| `imageMimeType`  | string       | No       | e.g., `image/jpeg` (legacy — prefer `attachments`)                         |
| `attachments`    | Attachment[] | No       | Structured media attachments (see below)                                   |

### Attachments

Use the `attachments` array for images, files, audio, and video. `handleInbound()` resolves them automatically: images with base64 `data` are sent to the model as vision input, files with a `filePath` get their path appended to the prompt so the agent can read them.

```typescript
interface Attachment {
  type: 'image' | 'file' | 'audio' | 'video';
  data?: string; // base64-encoded data (images, small files)
  filePath?: string; // absolute path to local file (large files saved to disk)
  mimeType: string; // e.g. 'application/pdf', 'image/jpeg'
  fileName?: string; // original file name from the platform
}
```

Example — handling a file upload in your adapter:

```typescript
import { writeFileSync, mkdirSync, existsSync } from 'node:fs';
import { join } from 'node:path';
import { tmpdir } from 'node:os';

const buf = await downloadFromPlatform(fileId);
const dir = join(tmpdir(), 'channel-files');
if (!existsSync(dir)) mkdirSync(dir, { recursive: true });
const filePath = join(dir, fileName);
writeFileSync(filePath, buf);

envelope.attachments = [
  {
    type: 'file',
    filePath,
    mimeType: 'application/pdf',
    fileName,
  },
];
```

The legacy `imageBase64`/`imageMimeType` fields still work for backwards compatibility but `attachments` is preferred for new code.

## Extension Manifest

Your `qwen-extension.json` declares the channel type. The key must match `channelType` in your plugin object:

```json
{
  "name": "my-channel-extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "channels": {
    "my-platform": {
      "entry": "dist/index.js",
      "displayName": "My Platform Channel"
    }
  }
}
```

## Optional Extension Points

**Custom slash commands** — register in your constructor:

```typescript
this.registerCommand('mycommand', async (envelope, args) => {
  await this.sendMessage(envelope.chatId, 'Response');
  return true; // handled, don't forward to agent
});
```

**Working indicators** — override `onPromptStart()` and `onPromptEnd()` to show platform-specific typing indicators. These hooks fire only when a prompt actually begins processing — not for buffered messages (collect mode) or gated/blocked messages:

```typescript
protected override onPromptStart(chatId: string, sessionId: string, messageId?: string): void {
  this.platformClient.sendTyping(chatId); // your platform API
}

protected override onPromptEnd(chatId: string, sessionId: string, messageId?: string): void {
  this.platformClient.stopTyping(chatId);
}
```

**Tool call hooks** — override `onToolCall()` to display agent activity (e.g., "Running shell command...").

**Streaming hooks** — override `onResponseChunk(chatId, chunk, sessionId, segment)` for per-chunk progressive display (e.g., editing a message in-place). Override `onResponseComplete(chatId, fullText, sessionId, segment)` to customize final delivery. In daemon-managed named-task mode, `segment.sourceLabel` is immutable delivery metadata for that segment. Render it once on each independently visible message or card, including a separately visible final response, but do not add it to raw buffers or model text. Clear adapter-owned segment state from `onOutputSegmentEnd()`.

**Block streaming** — set `blockStreaming: "on"` in the channel config. The base class automatically splits responses into multiple messages at paragraph boundaries. No plugin code needed — it works alongside `onResponseChunk`.

**Named-task attribution** — `sendThreadMessage(chatId, threadId, text, sourceLabel)` receives the same optional plain-text label for one-shot and proactive delivery boundaries. The default implementation handles plain messages. Adapters that override delivery, split messages, emit cards, or provide fallback sends must repeat the label at every independently visible boundary, escape only the label for the target markup dialect, and include its rendered size in platform limits. Run no-reply checks, media-marker projection, audit hashing, transcript persistence, and retry-body capture against the raw response before presentation; if delivery is persisted for restart-safe retry, persist the captured label separately.

Interactive `ChannelUserInputRequestContext` also carries `sourceLabel`. Cards, terminal replacements, and plain fallbacks must retain it without weakening the existing request, session, run, owner, and target checks.

**Proactive delivery** — override `supportsProactiveSend()` to return `true` when the adapter can send without an active inbound request. `ChannelBase` uses this capability for persistent channel loops, webhook tasks, background-agent results, and daemon delivery. The default target policy rejects threaded targets; override the protected target checks only for target shapes your platform can deliver safely:

```typescript
override supportsProactiveSend(): boolean {
  return true;
}

protected override supportsProactiveTarget(target: SessionTarget): boolean {
  return target.threadId === undefined;
}

protected override async pushProactive(
  target: SessionTarget,
  text: string,
  sourceLabel?: string,
): Promise<void> {
  await this.sendThreadMessage(
    target.chatId,
    target.threadId,
    text,
    sourceLabel,
  );
}
```

Use `supportsProactiveDeliveryTarget()` when generic daemon delivery accepts a different target shape, and `supportsProactiveWebhookTarget()` when webhook delivery differs from loops and background results. Keep unsupported targets rejected rather than falling back to another conversation.

**Media** — populate `envelope.attachments` with images/files. See [Attachments](#attachments) above.
