# Workspace MCP Transport Pool

## Overview

`McpTransportPool` (`packages/core/src/tools/mcp-transport-pool.ts`) is the F2 (#4175 commit 5) workspace-scoped pool: multiple ACP sessions inside one runtime share one transport per unique `(serverName + configFingerprint)` tuple, instead of each spawning its own MCP child process. When pool mode is enabled, every started ACP child owns an independent pool (`QwenAgent.mcpPool`). Production attempts to preheat the trusted primary child for compatibility; trusted secondaries start on demand, and an untrusted secondary starts neither the child nor its pool. Legacy primary routes retain their existing compatibility behavior. The pool is constructed once at agent startup with the runtime's bootstrap `Config` and survives session lifecycles. Entries reference-count session attaches and close after a configurable grace period when the reference count reaches zero.

It is the main mechanism that prevents a multi-session daemon from forking one copy of every MCP server per session.

## Responsibilities

- Acquire or spawn one MCP transport per `(name + fingerprint)`, deduplicating concurrent acquires via `spawnInFlight`.
- Release per-session references; arm the entry's drain timer when the last reference detaches.
- Survive ref-count churn with a hard `MAX_IDLE_MS` cap so a thrashing client cannot keep an idle transport alive forever.
- Reference-count sessions in a reverse index (`sessionToEntries`) so `releaseSession(sessionId)` is O(refs) rather than O(entries).
- Restart entries on demand (`restartByName`) — single-entry returns `{restarted, durationMs}`, multi-entry returns `{entries: RestartResult[]}` (F2 multi-entry contract).
- Drain the entire pool on daemon shutdown with a configurable timeout; refuse new acquires while draining.
- Consult `WorkspaceMcpBudget` (see [`06-mcp-budget-guardrails.md`](./06-mcp-budget-guardrails.md)) on `acquire` to enforce per-name reservation caps; release the slot on entry close when no sibling entry holds the same name.
- Produce per-session filtered tool/prompt snapshots via `SessionMcpView` so a discovery in one session does not register tools into other sessions.

## Architecture

### Public surface

```ts
class McpTransportPool {
  constructor(cliConfig: Config, options: McpTransportPoolOptions);
  acquire(
    serverName,
    cfg,
    sessionId,
    sessionToolRegistry,
    sessionPromptRegistry,
  ): Promise<PooledConnection>;
  release(id, sessionId): void;
  releaseSession(sessionId): void;
  restartByName(
    name,
    opts?,
  ): Promise<RestartResult | { entries: RestartResult[] }>;
  drainAll(opts?): Promise<void>;
  getBudget(): WorkspaceMcpBudget | undefined;
  getSnapshot(): McpPoolSnapshot;
}
```

`McpTransportPoolOptions`:

- `workspaceContext: WorkspaceContext` (required).
- `debugMode: boolean`.
- `sendSdkMcpMessage?` — per-session callback (pool bypasses SDK MCP).
- `pooledTransports?: ReadonlySet<McpTransportKind>` — default `{stdio, websocket}`. HTTP/SSE transports stay unpooled by default because their headers can carry session-specific OAuth state, but operators can explicitly opt them into pooling with `QWEN_SERVE_MCP_POOL_TRANSPORTS`.
- `drainDelayMs?` — default `30_000`.
- `entryOptions?: (transport) => PoolEntryOptions`.
- `budget?: WorkspaceMcpBudget`.

| `nextIndexByName`  | `Map<string, number>`                   | V21-7 monotonic `entryIndex` per server name (dashboards do not reshuffle when a new entry appears). |

### `PoolEntry` (per-entry structure, `mcp-pool-entry.ts`)

State machine: `spawning → active ⇄ (active ↔ reconnect) → (active → draining on last detach, draining → active on attach OR draining → closed on timer)`.

| Field                                                  | Purpose                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `localStatus: MCPServerStatus`                         | Driven by `MCPServerStatus` lifecycle.                                          |
| `state: PoolEntryState`                                | `spawning`/`active`/`draining`/`closed`/`failed`.                               |
| `generation: number`                                   | Bumped on each restart; subscribers compare to detect reconnect cycles.         |
| `refs: Set<string>`                                    | Session ids currently attached.                                                 |
| `subscribers: Map<string, SessionMcpView>`             | Per-session filtered views.                                                     |
| `subscriberHandles: Map<string, PooledConnectionImpl>` | Handles returned from `acquire`.                                                |
| `toolsSnapshot[], promptsSnapshot[]`                   | Canonical pool-level snapshots; re-issued on `toolsChanged` / `promptsChanged`. |
| `drainTimer?`                                          | Armed when `refs.size === 0`; default 30s. Reset on attach.                     |
| `maxIdleTimer?`                                        | Armed at first idle; never reset by acquire/release churn. Default 5 min.       |
| `firstIdleAt?`                                         | Watermark for the max-idle hard cap.                                            |
| `restartInFlight?`                                     | Mutex for `restart()`.                                                          |

### `PoolEntryOptions`

```ts
interface PoolEntryOptions {
  drainDelayMs: number; // default 30_000
  maxIdleMs: number; // default 5 * 60_000
  maxReconnectAttempts: number; // default 3 (stdio/ws) or 5 (http/sse)
  reconnectStrategy:
    | { kind: 'fixed'; delayMs: number }
    | { kind: 'exponential'; baseMs: number; capMs: number };
}
```

`defaultPoolEntryOptions(transport)` (`mcp-pool-entry.ts`) returns stdio/ws defaults `{fixed 5s, 3 attempts}` and http/sse defaults `{exponential 1s → 16s, 5 attempts}`. Remote transports get longer retry budgets because their failures are more often transient.

## Workflow

### `acquire`

```mermaid

    autonumber
    participant S as Session
    participant P as Pool
    participant SIF as spawnInFlight
    participant E as PoolEntry
    participant BDG as WorkspaceMcpBudget
    participant SRV as MCP server

    S->>P: acquire(name, cfg, sessionId, sessionToolRegistry, sessionPromptRegistry)
    P->>P: refuse if draining
    P->>P: connectionId = connectionIdOf(name, fingerprint)
    P->>P: if !isPoolable(cfg) → mark unpooled
    alt entry in entries (warm)
        E-->>P: existing PoolEntry
    else inflight cold spawn
        SIF-->>P: existing Promise<PoolEntry>
    else cold start
        P->>BDG: tryReserve(name) (if budget set + poolable)
        BDG-->>P: 'reserved' | 'already_held' | 'refused'
        alt refused
            P->>BDG: recordRefusal(name, transport)
            P-->>S: BudgetExhaustedError
        else ok
            P->>E: spawnEntry(name, cfg)
            E->>SRV: connect transport
            SRV-->>E: ready
            P->>P: entries.set(id, E); nextIndexByName++
            E-->>P: connected
        end
    end
    P->>E: addSubscriber(sessionId, sessionToolRegistry, sessionPromptRegistry)
    P->>P: sessionToEntries.add(sessionId, id)
    P->>P: cancel drain timer (refs>0)
    P-->>S: PooledConnection { id, serverName, entryIndex, client, toolsSnapshot, promptsSnapshot, on, off, release }
```

### `release` + drain

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant S as Session
    participant P as Pool
    participant E as PoolEntry
    participant BDG as WorkspaceMcpBudget

    S->>P: release(id, sessionId)
    P->>E: removeSubscriber(sessionId)
    P->>P: sessionToEntries.delete(sessionId, id)
    alt refs > 0
        E-->>P: ok
    else refs == 0
        E->>E: firstIdleAt = now (if unset)
        E->>E: arm drainTimer(drainDelayMs)
        E->>E: arm maxIdleTimer(maxIdleMs - elapsed)
    end
    Note over E: drainTimer fires →
    E->>SRV: disconnect transport
    E->>P: emit 'closed'
    P->>P: entries.delete(id)
    P->>P: if !hasNameSibling(name) → BDG.release(name)
```

`hasNameSibling(name)` (`mcp-transport-pool.ts`) iterates both `entries.values()` and `spawnInFlight.keys()` parsing the latter with `parseConnectionId` (server names can legitimately contain `::`, so `startsWith` would false-positive on a sibling name beginning with `${name}::`).

`releaseSession(sessionId)` reads from `sessionToEntries`, releases all referenced entries in O(refs), then clears the index entry. Used by the bridge's session-close path so it does not iterate the full entry map.

### `restartByName`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Op as POST /workspace/mcp/:server/restart
    participant P as Pool
    participant E as PoolEntry
    participant SRV as MCP server

    Op->>P: restartByName(name, opts?)
    alt opts.entryIndex specified
        P->>E: find entry by (name, entryIndex)
    else
        P->>P: gather all entries with matching name
    end
    par per entry
        P->>E: restart() (mutex via restartInFlight)
        E->>SRV: disconnect
        E->>SRV: reconnect
        E->>E: bump generation, re-emit snapshots
    end
    alt single entry
        P-->>Op: {restarted: true, durationMs}
    else multi-entry
        P-->>Op: {entries: [{restarted, durationMs, entryIndex}, ...]}
    end
```

The preflight budget check at the daemon HTTP layer returns `{restarted:false, skipped:true, reason:'budget_would_exceed'}` (Wave 4 mutation control) when the target's slot is not already reserved and a restart would push live count over `enforce` budget.

### `drainAll`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant D as Daemon shutdown
    participant P as Pool
    participant E as PoolEntries

    D->>P: drainAll({timeoutMs?})
    P->>P: draining = true (refuse new acquires)
    par for each entry
        P->>E: trigger drain (close transport, clear timers)
        E-->>P: closed
    end
    P-->>D: done (or timeout reached, force close)
```

## State & Lifecycle

- Pool construction is synchronous; first `acquire` cold-starts a transport.
- `drainDelayMs` (default 30s) is reset to cancellation on attach.
- `maxIdleMs` (default 5 min) is **never** reset by attach/detach — it starts ticking at the FIRST idle and only stops when the entry actually closes or attaches before the deadline. Defense against thrashing clients.
- `nextIndexByName` is monotonic. Old entries keep their assigned index even after newer ones appear, so dashboards reading `entryIndex` do not reshuffle.
- Spawn failure releases the reserved budget slot (V21-4 — without this, a cold spawn that crashed mid-connect would leak the reservation forever).

## Dependencies

- `packages/core/src/tools/mcp-client.ts` — `McpClient`, status enum, `SendSdkMcpMessage`.
- `packages/core/src/tools/mcp-pool-entry.ts` — `PoolEntry`, `PoolEntryOptions`, `defaultPoolEntryOptions`.
- `packages/core/src/tools/mcp-pool-key.ts` — `connectionIdOf`, `parseConnectionId`, `isPoolable`, `mcpTransportOf`, `POOLED_TRANSPORTS_DEFAULT`.
- `packages/core/src/tools/mcp-pool-events.ts` — `ConnectionId`, `PoolEntryState`, `PoolEvent`.
- `packages/core/src/tools/session-mcp-view.ts` — per-session view that filters pool snapshots.
- `packages/core/src/tools/mcp-workspace-budget.ts` — `WorkspaceMcpBudget` (see [`06-mcp-budget-guardrails.md`](./06-mcp-budget-guardrails.md)).
- `packages/core/src/tools/mcp-discovery-timeout.ts` — `discoveryTimeoutFor`, `runWithTimeout`.

## Configuration

| Source                        | Knob                                                            | Effect                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Env                           | `QWEN_SERVE_NO_MCP_POOL=1`                                      | Kill switch — `QwenAgent.mcpPool` stays undefined; per-session `McpClientManager` enforces (pre-F2 path). |
| Flag                          | `--mcp-client-budget=N`, `--mcp-budget-mode={off,warn,enforce}` | Forwarded to ACP child via `childEnvOverrides`; child constructs `WorkspaceMcpBudget` and passes to pool. |
| Capability tags (conditional) | `mcp_workspace_pool`, `mcp_pool_restart`                        | Advertised together when pool is on. SDK pre-flights both to branch on pool-aware response shapes.        |

### Unpooled entries (HTTP / SSE / SDK-MCP)

Transports outside the configured `pooledTransports` allowlist (HTTP, SSE, and SDK-MCP by default) take a separate path: `createUnpooledConnection(name, cfg, sessionId, ...)` (`mcp-transport-pool.ts`) creates a per-session entry with id `${name}::unpooled-${entryIndex}`. Differences from pooled entries:

- Stored in `entries` AND tracked in `unpooledIds: Set<ConnectionId>` so `release` / `releaseSession` can fast-path the close-on-detach behavior (refs always max out at 1).
- `McpClient.discover()` is used directly instead of pool replay; `applyTools` / `applyPrompts` are no-ops because the session's registries already hold what was registered (W77 / `skipReplay: true` in `attach()`).
- Workspace budget still gates them — the F2 budget follow-up closed the prior loophole where unpooled connections bypassed `tryReserve`; the same `WorkspaceMcpBudget` slot is reserved and released on entry close (whether pooled or unpooled).

The W77 race (`cb206da36`): `createUnpooledConnection` stores the entry in `this.entries` BEFORE awaiting `client.connect()` / `client.discover()`, but only indexes `sessionToEntries[sessionId]` AFTER `attach()` succeeds. A concurrent `closeStoredSession()` / `releaseSession(sessionId)` during the connect/discover window saw an empty index, let the unpooled spawn finish, and `attach()` then registered tools/prompts into an already-closed session. The fix:

- `mcp-pool-entry.ts`: public `isTerminated(): boolean` probe (`state === 'closed' || state === 'failed'`).
- `mcp-pool-entry.ts`: `markActive()` short-circuits if `isTerminated()` so a torn-down entry cannot be resurrected to `'active'`.
- Callers (the pool's unpooled path) probe `isTerminated()` between the awaits and abort the attach if the parent session went away.

This race was latent at the time (the W61/W71 per-session `releaseSession` hooks land in F4), but would become live the moment that hook arrived. The fix was applied early in the F2 series.

## `GET /workspace/mcp` pool-aware snapshot fields

When the pool is active, each `ServeWorkspaceMcpStatus` server cell
(`packages/acp-bridge/src/status.ts`) includes three additional fields:

| Field            | Type                                        | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `disabledReason` | `'config' \| 'budget'`                      | Distinguishes operator-disabled servers (`disabled: true` from `disabledMcpServers`) from budget refusal (`status: 'error', errorKind: 'budget_exhausted'`). Dashboards can render one server row without cross-reading `errors[]` or `budgets[]`.                                                                                            |
| `entryCount`     | `number` (`>=1`)                            | In pool mode a workspace can have multiple `PoolEntry` instances with the same name when sessions inject different fingerprints such as per-session OAuth headers. This field is absent when `QWEN_SERVE_NO_MCP_POOL=1` disables the pool. New clients render an "N entries" badge when `entryCount > 1`.                                     |
| `entrySummary`   | `ReadonlyArray<{entryIndex, refs, status}>` | Per-entry breakdown. `entryIndex` is the stable opaque integer assigned when the entry was created; it is not the raw fingerprint, so snapshot diffs do not leak OAuth or env rotation timing. `refs` is the current attached-session count. `status` lets dashboards show per-entry health while aggregate `mcpStatus` is already connected. |

`(entryCount, entrySummary)` are always broadcast as a pair. The
`mcp_workspace_pool` capability tag implies both fields. Older SDK clients
ignore them under the additive protocol contract.

Pool snapshots also expose `subprocessCount`. It counts only the `'stdio'`
family. WebSocket, HTTP, and SSE transports connect to remote servers and do
not spawn local child processes. Early versions counted WebSocket transports as
local subprocesses, which inflated resource dashboards.

## Drain runs from both shutdown paths

Pool drain is not limited to the SIGTERM handler. The normal IDE shutdown path
(`await connection.closed`) also calls `drainAll` via
`packages/cli/src/acp-integration/acpAgent.ts`'s `drainPoolBeforeExit`. Whether
the daemon receives a process signal or the IDE closes its connection cleanly,
the pool enters `draining`, refuses new acquires, and waits for entries to
close.

## `/mcp refresh` shares the boot discovery path

`discoverAllMcpTools` (boot discovery) and
`discoverAllMcpToolsIncremental` (`/mcp refresh` / hot reload) both consult the
pool first in pool mode (`packages/core/src/tools/mcp-client-manager.ts`). The
shared gate prevents hot reload from accidentally creating a per-session
client, double-counting budget, or leaving an orphan transport behind.

## In-flight tool calls during reconnect (`MCPCallInterruptedError`)

When the underlying MCP transport silently disconnects (the connection jumps
from `'active'` / `'draining'` to `localStatus === DISCONNECTED` without an
explicit close), the pool marks the entry `'failed'`, evicts it from
`pool.entries`, and emits the `failed` event before detaching subscriber views.
That emit-before-detach order matters: subscribers receive the `failed` event
soon enough to route pending `callTool` promises to
`MCPCallInterruptedError`, so a stuck `await client.callTool(...)` rejects
cleanly instead of hanging. `forceShutdown` uses the same emit-then-detach
ordering.

## Fingerprint and `canonicalOAuth` normalization

The pool key comes from `fingerprint(cfg)` in `mcp-pool-key.ts`. The hash covers
all transport-defining fields:

> `transport, command, args, cwd, env, url, httpUrl, tcp, headers, timeout, versionNegotiation, oauth`

Per-session filtering and metadata fields (`includeTools`, `excludeTools`,
`trust`, `description`, `extensionName`, `discoveryTimeoutMs`) are excluded, so
sessions with different filters can share one entry. The automatic negotiation
opt-in is included because it changes how the underlying process connects.

For the OAuth cell, `canonicalOAuth(o)` hashes every `MCPOAuthConfig` field:
`clientId`, `clientSecret`, sorted `scopes`, sorted `audiences`,
`authorizationUrl`, `tokenUrl`, `redirectUri`, `tokenParamName`, and
`registrationUrl`. This is the credential-isolation contract: two session
configs that differ only by `clientSecret`, `audiences`, or `redirectUri` get
different fingerprints and cannot share one entry. Confidential clients and
multi-audience token deployments depend on this.

Sorting `scopes` and `audiences` makes callsite order irrelevant. Explicit
`null` is normalized so undefined fields hash the same as explicit null. The
key does not include `discoveryTimeoutMs`; concurrent acquire calls with the
same key but different timeouts are "first wins", matching the pre-F2
per-session manager behavior.

`PoolEntry` keeps `cfg: MCPServerConfig` private. External code must use the
`entry.transportKind` getter when it needs the transport family. That prevents
env, header auth, and OAuth fields from leaking to consumers by accident.

## Extension unloads rely on `MAX_IDLE_MS`

There is intentionally no active cleanup path for unloading an MCP extension at
runtime. Orphan entries whose `MCPServerConfig` no longer appears in the merged
workspace settings are reclaimed naturally by the `MAX_IDLE_MS` hard cap after
the last subscriber detaches. A synchronous unload-cleanup path would add
complexity for a rare operator edge case; the hard cap limits orphan process
lifetime past the unload point to 5 minutes by default.

Operators who need faster cleanup can restart the daemon or call
`POST /workspace/mcp/:server/restart` for the now-unconfigured name, which goes
through the disabled-server path and tears the entry down.

## Self-heal observability

The pool emits two structured diagnostics on the self-heal path:

**`McpClient.lastTransportError: Error | undefined`** (`packages/core/src/tools/mcp-client.ts`) — `McpClient.onerror` stores the most recent transport exception in a private field and clears it at `connect()` entry. The `PoolEntry` silent-drop path reads `client.getLastTransportError()` and includes it in `emit({kind:'failed', lastError})`, so subscribers and dashboards do not have to grep stderr for root cause.

**`SweepResult`** (internal interface, not exported; `packages/core/src/tools/mcp-pool-entry.ts`) — `sweepAndDisconnect(reason)` returns `Promise<SweepResult>`:

```ts
interface SweepResult {
  pidSweepError?: Error; // listDescendantPids itself threw
  descendantsFound?: number; // descendant pid count found
  descendantsSignaled?: number; // successfully SIGTERM'd count
}
```

The only consumer is the silent-drop block in `statusChangeListener`. It uses
`descendantsFound` / `descendantsSignaled` to detect partial-signal cases
(fewer processes signaled than found, usually because a process exited or EPERM
occurred between `listDescendantPids` and `sigtermPids`) and sweep errors, then
logs a structured warning. `forceShutdown` and `doRestart` ignore this return
value because their catch paths already carry richer failure signals.

## Subprocess cleanup: the `pid-descendants` snapshot path

When `McpTransportPool` shuts down stdio subprocesses, it has to enumerate their
descendant processes; `npx` wrappers and shell wrappers can create multiple fork
levels. `packages/core/src/tools/pid-descendants.ts` exposes
`listDescendantPids(rootPid) → Promise<number[]>` and `sigtermPids(pids)` for
`sweepAndDisconnect`.

### Linux / macOS primary path

A single `ps -A -o pid=,ppid=` snapshot reads the process table, parses it into
`Map<ppid, pid[]>`, then `walkDescendants(tree, root)` performs BFS to extract
the subtree. Any depth requires only one `ps` fork.

`walkDescendants` maintains `visited: Set<number>` and includes `root` in the
set to defend against PID-reuse cycles. Under fast process churn, the snapshot
can theoretically contain A→B / B→A loops. Without `visited`, the walker could
fill the `MAX_DESCENDANTS` quota with bogus data and crowd out real descendants.

### Windows primary path

A single `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | ConvertTo-Csv -Delimiter ","`
snapshot emits all `(ProcessId, ParentProcessId)` rows, then the same `Map` and
`walkDescendants` path runs.

The explicit `-Delimiter ","` is required. PowerShell 5.1, which ships with
Windows, defaults `ConvertTo-Csv` to the system locale list separator; DE, FR,
NL, IT, and similar locales use `;`, so the pre-fix parser
`^"(\d+)","(\d+)"$` never matched and every daemon shutdown fell back to the
per-pid CIM filter path, adding roughly 0.5-1s of PowerShell startup cost per
child.

### Fallback path

BusyBox `<v1.28` lacks `ps -o`, distroless containers might not include `ps`,
and some Windows environments truncate CIM output via ACLs. When the primary
path parses zero rows or throws, the code falls back to per-pid BFS: Linux /
macOS use `pgrep -P <pid>`, and Windows uses
`Get-CimInstance -Filter "ParentProcessId=$p"` where `$p` is a PowerShell
variable binding rather than string concatenation. The current
`Number.isInteger` guard is sufficient for the entry point; the binding is
defense-in-depth.

### Shared constraints

Both paths are bounded by `MAX_DESCENDANTS = 256` and `MAX_DEPTH = 8` to keep a
malicious or degenerate process tree from dragging down sweep.

The snapshot path uses `maxBuffer: 8MB`, enough for pathological hosts with
about 250k processes. Node's default 1MB buffer can truncate child-process
output around 30k processes.

The performance gain is intentionally modest (typical 200-500 process dev
machines parse in under 10ms, around 2x faster than per-pid `pgrep`). The main
benefit is fork hygiene and snapshot consistency: BFS sees the full subtree at
once, while the previous per-pid query path could miss a grandchild forked
between two queries.

## Embedder note: `McpClientManager` constructor

`McpClientManager` is constructed as
`(config, toolRegistry, options?: McpClientManagerOptions)`. Embedders that
import the class directly should pass:

```ts
new McpClientManager(config, toolRegistry, {
  eventEmitter,
  sendSdkMcpMessage,
  healthConfig,
  budgetConfig,
  pool,
});
```

Tests should prefer an `mkManager(overrides?)` factory so cases that care about
one or two fields stay one line.

## Implementation notes

These helpers are internal, but source readers may see them:

- `McpTransportPool.acquire()` uses `attachPooledSession` and `rollbackReservationOnSpawnFailure` to share fast-path attach, post-spawn attach, and pooled spawn-in-flight catch behavior. Runtime behavior is unchanged; race-window invariants still live at the call sites.
- `SessionMcpView.applyTools` / `applyPrompts` compile `includeTools` / `excludeTools` once via `compileNameFilter(cfg)` and check each tool with `compiledFilterAccepts(compiled, name)`. Exported `passesSessionFilter` / `passesSessionPromptFilter` use the same compiled path. `excludeTools` is exact-match; `includeTools` strips the first `(...)` suffix so `toolName(args)` matches `toolName`.

Design document: [`../../design/f2-mcp-transport-pool.md`](../../design/f2-mcp-transport-pool.md) §6 covers the transport pool state machine, reconnect, drain, and descendant sweep paths.

## Caveats & Known Limits

- **HTTP / SSE transports are unpooled by default** — unless operators explicitly include them in `QWEN_SERVE_MCP_POOL_TRANSPORTS`, each acquire mints a fresh entry that lives only as long as its session. Their headers may carry session-specific OAuth state, so pooling them by default would risk leaking credentials across sessions.
- **`maxIdleMs` is a hard cap that survives attach/detach churn.** A 5-minute idle hard cap means even an aggressively attaching/detaching client cannot keep an idle transport pinned past 5 minutes. Operators who want pinned long-lived transports should increase `maxIdleMs` or run the server outside the pool.
- **Per-server-name budget slots** mean two pool entries that share a name but differ by fingerprint consume ONE slot together, not two. Subprocess accounting is exposed separately via `pool.getSnapshot().subprocessCount`.
- **`startsWith` regression** was avoided in `hasNameSibling` because MCP server names can legitimately contain `::` (`mcp-pool-key.test.ts`). Always use `parseConnectionId`'s `lastIndexOf('::')` split, never string-prefix matching.
- **Pool draining is one-way** — `drainAll` sets `draining = true` permanently; a fresh pool is required for further work.
