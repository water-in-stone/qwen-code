# Standalone PR6 WebShell Product UI Plan

## Goal

Turn the explicit daemon session contexts delivered by PR5 (#10418) into the
visible standalone-chat product defined by
`docs/design/standalone-daemon-sessions.md` (§PR6). Home and global **New
Chat** create standalone sessions on capable daemons; project-scoped entry
points stay workspace-bound; a top-level **Recents** group manages standalone
sessions through their full lifecycle; standalone chats hide every
project-only surface. No behavior falls back to the primary workspace unless
the daemon lacks `standalone_sessions_v1`.

This PR touches only `packages/web-shell`. The #9811 WebShell cutover
(`fe34a5cf22`) moved the PR5 provider surface from `packages/webui` into
`packages/web-shell/client/daemon/session/`, so PR6 is fully contained in one
package. It adds no daemon route and no SDK method.

Suggested title: `feat(web-shell): Add standalone chats`.

## Merged Contract This PR Consumes

Verified against `origin/main` (PR3 `34a6e918b6`, PR4 `7357136dd1`, PR5
`ac761e11c2`, cutover `fe34a5cf22`).

### Daemon (packages/cli/src/serve)

- Routes registered by `registerStandaloneSessionRoutes`
  (`routes/standalone-sessions.ts:247`):
  `POST/GET /standalone/sessions`, `GET /standalone/sessions/:id`,
  `POST .../load`, `POST .../resume`, `POST .../repair-directory`,
  `PATCH .../metadata`, `GET .../export`, `POST .../archive`,
  `POST .../unarchive`, `POST .../delete`.
- Capability `standalone_sessions_v1` registered at
  `capabilities.ts:136`, advertised only when the full dependency set is
  installed.
- Standalone creation rejects workspace-only request keys (`cwd`,
  `workspaceCwd`, `sourceType`, `sourceId`, `sessionScope`, `branch`,
  `worktree`) with `400 invalid_request`.

### SDK (packages/sdk-typescript/src/daemon)

- `STANDALONE_SESSIONS_CAPABILITY = 'standalone_sessions_v1'`
  (`standalone-sessions.ts:16`).
- `DaemonClient`: `createStandaloneSession` (generates the UUID, wraps
  response loss into `DaemonStandaloneCreationOutcomeUnknownError` carrying
  `sessionId` + exact-lookup `recovery`, never auto-retries; accepts only
  `sessionId?`, `modelServiceId?`, `approvalMode?`),
  `listStandaloneSessions(Page)`, `getStandaloneSession` (exact lookup:
  creating / summary / not-found), `loadStandaloneSession`,
  `resumeStandaloneSession`, `repairStandaloneSessionDirectory`,
  `renameStandaloneSession`, `exportStandaloneSession`,
  `archiveStandaloneSessions`, `unarchiveStandaloneSessions`,
  `deleteStandaloneSessions` (batch result with `removed`, `notFound`,
  `errors`, `fileCleanupPending`). All standalone methods are
  capability-gated.
- `DaemonSessionClient.createStandalone / loadStandalone /
resumeStandalone` statics and the `{ kind: 'standalone' }` restore
  strategy (`DaemonSessionClient.ts:444-485`, restore dispatch at :710).

### Session provider (packages/web-shell/client/daemon/session, post-#9811)

- `DaemonProductSessionContext` (`types.ts:71`):
  `{ kind: 'workspace'; cwd } | { kind: 'standalone' } | { kind: 'live' }`.
- `DaemonSessionProviderProps.sessionContext` (types.ts:160) alongside
  legacy `workspaceCwd`; conflicts throw before any request.
- Actions `createSession` / `loadSession` / `resumeSession` accept
  `options.sessionContext` (types.ts:438-471). Standalone create is not
  retried and is exempt from the generic 30 s action timeout; Live create is
  rejected by this provider.
- The standalone creation lane (`createDetachedStandaloneSession`,
  `DaemonSessionProvider.tsx:3968`) forwards only `modelServiceId` and
  `approvalMode` to `DaemonSessionClient.createStandalone` — workspace-only
  fields never reach the daemon.
- Connection state exposes `sessionContext` and
  `standaloneSession?: DaemonStandaloneConnectionState`
  (`{ projectlessOutputDirectory?, workingDirectory?, creationRecovery?,
errorCode? }`, types.ts:76-82, 94-98). Directory error codes are copied
  into `standaloneSession.errorCode` for UI branching.
- `session-context.ts` helpers: `resolveProviderSessionContext`,
  `resolveActionSessionContext`, `sessionContextKey`,
  `restoreSessionContextMatches`, `getDaemonErrorCode`,
  `isDaemonErrorExplicitlyNonRetryable`, `getStandaloneConnectionState`.
- PR5 isolation guarantee: standalone/Live sessions skip workspace
  providers, skills, ACP preheat, Git status, and workspace event
  invalidation inside the provider already.

## Entry-Point Routing

Fixed by the umbrella contract; PR6 wires each visible entry point to an
explicit context:

| Entry point                                      | New-session context      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Home / global **New Chat**                       | `standalone`             |
| **New Chat** inside a selected or locked project | `workspace`              |
| Goals and Git entry points                       | `workspace`              |
| Current-session **New Chat**                     | Inherit explicit context |
| Live Voice                                       | `live`                   |

Implementation map (`packages/web-shell/client`, line numbers verified
against `origin/main` after the #9811 cutover; the product UI currently has
zero `sessionContext` references and passes legacy `workspaceCwd`
everywhere):

- **Home / global New Chat** — sidebar primary nav `handleNewSession()`
  (call site `components/sidebar/WebShellSidebar.tsx:5097`) →
  `createNewSession()` (`App.tsx:8641`). Today this only clears; creation is
  lazy. With capability, it sets pending context `{ kind: 'standalone' }`.
  The Home first-prompt path (`ensureSessionForPrompt`, `App.tsx:6179`,
  target-cwd resolution inside it →
  `utils/sessionPreparation.ts#createAndAttachSessionForPrompt`) consumes
  the pending context instead of resolving locked/selected/primary cwd.
- **Standalone creation omits workspace-only fields** (review P1).
  `createAndAttachSessionForPrompt` always passes
  `sourceType: WEB_SHELL_SESSION_SOURCE_TYPE` and may pass
  `worktree`/`branch`; the daemon rejects all of these on the standalone
  route, and the provider's standalone lane accepts neither. The creation
  flow therefore branches: a standalone pending context dispatches
  `createSession({ sessionContext: { kind: 'standalone' }, approvalMode? })`
  only — never the generic helper's `sourceType`/`worktree`/`branch`
  payload. Tests assert the exact request body for both branches.
- **Every new-session caller passes explicit intent** (review P1): global
  New Chat, current-session New Chat, `/new`, `/clear`, the new-session
  suggestion, and the shell API all reach the same `createNewSession()`
  today, and Goals passes an undefined cwd while needing workspace — with a
  workspace active context, the callee cannot distinguish global standalone
  creation from current-session workspace inheritance. The caller contract
  becomes an explicit intent: `{ kind: 'global' }` (Home/global New Chat →
  standalone when capable), `{ kind: 'inherit' }` (current-session
  entries), or an explicit `{ kind: 'workspace', cwd }` (project New Chat,
  Goals). Intent is never inferred from an undefined cwd or current state,
  and every real callsite is covered by tests.
- **Project-scoped New Chat** — `handleNewSession(wsCwd)`
  (`WebShellSidebar.tsx:5514`) → `createNewSession({ kind: 'workspace',
cwd: wsCwd })` under the new intent contract.
- **Goals** — `onCreateGoal` (`App.tsx:13223`) first resolves the target
  cwd exactly as today (locked ?? selected ?? primary), then calls
  `createNewSession({ kind: 'workspace', cwd: resolved },
{ keepView: true })` + `ensureSessionForPrompt`; stays workspace-bound,
  ignoring any standalone pending context. It never passes a bare
  `undefined` cwd.
- **Git** — `resolveSessionForWorkspace` (`App.tsx:6661`) and the composer
  git chips (gated by `gitModeEligible`, `App.tsx:6763`); stays
  workspace-bound.
- **Scheduled Tasks and other workspace-maintenance callers** (review P1):
  `ScheduledTasksDialog.onCreateViaChat` resolves an explicit workspace cwd
  and passes `{ kind: 'workspace', cwd }` — durable standalone scheduling
  is out of scope, so an active standalone context must never choose
  inherit/global here. The same rule audits every remaining
  workspace-maintenance callsite, with a standalone→Scheduled-Tasks
  regression test.
- **Current-session New Chat** (`{ kind: 'inherit' }`) — inherits the
  active `connection.sessionContext`: standalone → pending standalone,
  workspace → pending workspace with the current cwd (today's behavior). A
  Live current session routes through the existing Live-specific
  `startLive('new')` path (`client/live/useLiveVoice`) before any clearing,
  never a silent remap to standalone — the routing contract's "inherit
  explicit context" row stays intact (review P1).
- **Split view excludes standalone sessions in PR6, at every ingress**
  (review P1): pane identity is persisted as bare `sessionId` strings
  (split URL, sessionStorage) and pane ownership derives from workspace
  catalogs, so a standalone pane has no context source after a cold split
  URL or refresh and would fall through to workspace resolution. Blocking
  only the Recents row is insufficient — the global footer button can seed
  the current `connection.sessionId`, and `?split=`, sessionStorage
  restoration, and externally controlled `splitSessionIds` can all inject a
  bare standalone ID. PR6 disables the global Split View entry for
  non-workspace effective contexts and rejects or sanitizes standalone IDs
  at every seed, URL, storage, and controlled-prop boundary before panes
  mount. Because bare ids carry no context, sanitization uses a fail-closed
  async classifier before panes mount: on a capable daemon, an unmapped id
  is exact-checked via `getStandaloneSession` — standalone or `creating`
  ids are rejected, and only a `404` continues through workspace ownership
  resolution. The classifier has a cancellable pending state, treats lookup
  errors as rejection, and hands the controlled host the sanitized set so
  it cannot immediately re-inject a stripped id. Delayed-catalog and
  controlled-prop tests cover this. Context-bearing pane descriptors are a
  follow-up.
- **Context propagation** — `WorkspaceSessionProvider`
  (`components/WorkspaceSessionProvider.tsx`) still passes legacy
  `workspaceCwd` into `DaemonSessionProvider`; PR6 passes the resolved
  `sessionContext` prop instead (the provider normalizes legacy cwd at its
  compatibility boundary, so both forms remain valid during the cutover).
- **Loading existing sessions** — `loadSidebarSession` (`App.tsx:9114`)
  currently passes `{ workspaceCwd }`; for standalone entries it calls
  `loadSession(id, { sessionContext: { kind: 'standalone' } })`.

Legacy callers that pass only `workspaceCwd` keep today's behavior
untouched.

## Capability Dual Behavior

Read the capability from `useWorkspace().capabilities.features` —
`DaemonWorkspaceProvider` fetches `client.capabilities()` once at startup,
before any session exists, so entry points (which fire before a session)
must not rely on the session-scoped `connection.capabilities`. Compare
against `STANDALONE_SESSIONS_CAPABILITY` from `@qwen-code/sdk/daemon`.

The capability value is tri-state (review P1), and only one state may fall
back to legacy behavior:

- **Loading** (`capabilities === undefined` while the startup fetch is in
  flight): Home and global New Chat wait — the standalone decision is
  disabled, not defaulted. Treating loading as absent could silently create
  a primary-workspace session on a capable daemon.
- **Loaded-absent** (old daemon): preserve legacy behavior — global New
  Chat targets the primary workspace. Do not call any standalone route. An
  informational hint that standalone chats need a daemon upgrade is
  allowed.
- **Load error**: fail closed with an explicit retry; no session creation
  in either context until capabilities resolve.
- **Loaded-present, creation fails**: display the structured error and
  preserve standalone intent for retry. Never silently create a
  primary-workspace session; never downgrade the context after a `503`
  ownership/runtime failure or a `409` directory conflict.

## Deferred Creation and Pending Context

WebShell creates the daemon session lazily on first prompt for the Home
flow (`createNewSession` only clears; `ensureSessionForPrompt` materializes
on submit). PR6 stores an explicit pending context alongside that deferred
intent:

- A new App-level `pendingSessionContext:
DaemonProductSessionContext | undefined` state, set by every entry point
  above. Pending context is a `DaemonProductSessionContext`, never a bare
  `undefined` cwd — "no cwd yet" is not standalone semantics.
- `ensureSessionForPrompt` (`App.tsx:6179`) prefers the pending context:
  `{ kind: 'standalone' }` → the standalone creation branch (no
  workspace-only fields); a workspace pending context → today's exact-cwd
  path; none → legacy locked/selected/primary resolution.
- **Pending context stays authoritative until attach commits** (review
  P1). Ordinary `409`/`503` creation failures do not publish a standalone
  connection context, and a cleared provider can still hold the previous
  workspace context — so routing and draft-UI gates read
  `pendingSessionContext ?? connection.sessionContext`, and the pending
  state is cleared only after create-and-attach completes successfully. A
  failed attempt leaves the pending standalone intent (and its error)
  visible for retry.
- `loadSidebarSession` / `switchWorkspace` (`App.tsx:8703`) overwrite the
  pending context with the loaded session's explicit context.
- The provider's own deferred path (`shouldDeferInitialSessionCreation`)
  keeps working unchanged underneath.

## Recents and Lifecycle Actions

- Add a top-level **Recents** group in the sidebar
  (`components/sidebar/WebShellSidebar.tsx`). No cross-context list exists
  today: `useScopedSessions` / `useWebShellSessions`
  (`session-catalog/session-catalog-hooks.ts`) are keyed by
  `SessionCatalogQuery { routeKind, workspaceCwd }`
  (`session-catalog/session-catalog-store.ts:11`) — workspace-scoped by
  construction. PR6 adds a standalone catalog lane fed by
  `listStandaloneSessionsPage` (cursor pagination, `archiveState` filter)
  rather than forcing standalone rows through the workspace catalog store.
  Live sessions and project sessions keep their existing groups; standalone
  children (sub-sessions with `parentSessionId`) never appear.
- **The internal Conversations cwd never leaks through Recents** (review
  P2). Standalone summaries retain an internal `workspaceCwd` for protocol
  routing, and the existing session-details row renders `workspaceCwd` as a
  project folder. Recents rows therefore use a standalone-specific view
  model that drops `workspaceCwd` entirely, and a standalone-specific
  action dispatch that never passes it to project details, navigation, or
  workspace resolvers.
- Per-session actions reuse the existing
  `WebShellSidebarSessionActionItem` menu pattern
  (`WebShellSidebar.tsx:270`: details | rename | export | delete | pin |
  archive) but dispatch to the standalone SDK routes: **rename**
  (`renameStandaloneSession`), **export** (`exportStandaloneSession`),
  **archive** / **unarchive** (batch routes), **delete**
  (`deleteStandaloneSessions`). Workspace-only actions (pin, group) are not
  offered on standalone rows.
- Delete retains the existing second-confirmation dialog pattern
  (`DeleteSessionDialog`) and states that the transcript and private files
  are removed. On success the session leaves Recents even when the response
  carries `fileCleanupPending`; that subset is surfaced as a non-blocking
  notice, not a blocking error.
- **Archived standalone sessions stay reachable** (review P2): the lazy
  Archived section gains a standalone `archiveState=archived` lane — today
  that section is backed by workspace catalogs only, while the umbrella
  contract requires archived standalone sessions to remain visible. Because
  PR5 deliberately skips workspace event invalidation for standalone
  contexts, the standalone lanes refresh explicitly after create, prompt
  completion, and every lifecycle action.
- **Batch outcomes are interpreted per session id** (review P2): archive,
  unarchive, and delete return partial-success envelopes even with HTTP 200. The catalog updates only when the target id appears in
  `archived`/`alreadyArchived`, `unarchived`/`alreadyActive`, or
  `removed`/`notFound` as appropriate; an id in `errors` keeps its row and
  surfaces the per-session code/message. `fileCleanupPending` is only an
  additional notice for an otherwise removed id.

## Project-Only Surface Hiding

In a standalone (or Live) chat, hide: workspace/project selector, Git
status/branch/worktree controls, project file browser, project settings,
pin/group controls, and attachments/uploads (standalone MVP excludes
uploads). Model, approval, tool, permission, transcript, and supported
metadata controls remain.

- Gate on the effective context (`pendingSessionContext ??
connection.sessionContext`) so draft standalone chats hide project
  surfaces before the session exists — never on the presence of a cwd. The
  established pattern to extend is `ordinaryWorkspaces` /
  `isKnownLiveWorkspaceCwd` (`App.tsx:2401-2405`), which already hides
  project UI for the Live runtime; PR6 generalizes it to "current chat is
  not a workspace context".
- **Composer state is isolated, not just hidden** (review P1/P2): clearing
  a workspace session preserves `connection.commands`/`skills`, and
  `createNewSession` with no cwd reloads primary-workspace skills, while
  `atWorkspaceCwd` falls back to the primary workspace when no session
  exists — so `useComposerCore` would select workspace-scoped draft and
  input-history keys and expose project commands/skills in a standalone
  draft. Commands, skills, `atWorkspaceCwd`, and composer storage identity
  all derive from the effective product context: a standalone draft skips
  the workspace skill reload, keeps only local built-in commands before
  attach, uses a standalone-specific draft/history identity with no primary
  fallback, and after attach uses only the standalone session's
  session-supported data. Covered by a workspace→standalone transition test
  with stale commands, skills, draft, and history snapshots.
- **Workspace effects and slash-command handlers gate on context too**
  (review P1): a sessionless App derives `activeWorkspaceCwd` from
  locked/selected/primary and starts the Git-status effect, and `/diff`,
  `/log`, `/prs`, `/settings`, `/schedule`, `/memory add` can open or
  default to workspace-scoped flows — hidden controls alone leave these
  live against the primary workspace. A workspace-eligible cwd is derived
  only when `effectiveContext.kind === 'workspace'` and gates background
  effects, command discovery, and submit-time handlers; tests assert zero
  workspace requests or panels from both pending and attached standalone
  contexts.
- **Generic transcript branching is excluded from standalone** (review
  P1): `/branch` and the per-message Branch action call
  `POST /session/:id/branch`, whose route is registered with
  `rejectStandalone: true` (`packages/cli/src/serve/routes/session.ts`) —
  the action deterministically fails for standalone sessions. Pending and
  attached standalone contexts omit the Branch action, drop `/branch` from
  command discovery, and block its submit-time handler; tests assert no
  generic branch request is issued. `/fork` stays separate — guarded
  background fork-agent work is supported.
- **The workspace Web Terminal is gated off in non-workspace contexts**
  (review P1): `webTerminalAvailable` (`App.tsx:3206`) checks only the
  `web_terminal` capability, but a standalone connection exposes no product
  `workspaceCwd`, so `TerminalPanel` would open the terminal route without
  a cwd and the daemon rejects it with `Terminal workspace unavailable` —
  the generic route resolves only registered trusted workspaces. Standalone
  sessions still run ordinary Shell/tool commands in their private
  directory through the session permission pipeline; this gates only the
  separate terminal surface. Terminal availability and the open handler
  require `effectiveContext.kind === 'workspace'`, inherited terminal tabs
  are discarded or closed when entering a non-workspace context, and tests
  assert pending and attached standalone/Live contexts create no terminal
  WebSocket while workspace terminals remain unchanged.
- **The legacy input-history fallback is disabled for standalone
  identities** (review P1): `useComposerCore`/`useInputHistory` fall back
  to the unscoped `qwen-web-shell-history` key whenever a scoped history is
  empty, so a standalone-specific key alone would still surface legacy
  workspace-era prompts. The fallback policy becomes
  product-context-aware — no legacy/global fallback for a non-workspace
  history identity — tested with an empty standalone history while the
  legacy key is populated.
- Component list (`origin/main`): composer workspace selector
  (`components/WorkspaceSelector.tsx`, rendered `ChatEditor.tsx:3116`);
  Git chips/popovers (`GitBranchIndicator`, `GitModePopover`,
  `BranchPickerPopover`, gated by `gitBranchVisible`,
  `ChatEditor.tsx:2435`); Git dialogs (`GitDialog` et al.); project
  settings panel (`openPanel('settings')` + workspace-scoped
  `useSettings`); @-mention file browser (`components/AtMentionPanel.tsx`,
  `hooks/useAtMentionMenu.ts`); pin/group controls
  (`SESSION_ORGANIZATION_FEATURE` sidebar grouping).
- Uploads have two lanes, both hidden in the standalone MVP: (1) workspace
  file upload — `hooks/useFileUpload.ts` → `client.uploadWorkspaceFile`,
  rendered via `composer/AddMenu.tsx` and the @-panel "Upload file" item,
  already kill-switched by `fileUploadEnabled` and the
  `workspace_file_upload` capability (`ChatEditor.tsx:1585-1588`); (2)
  inline prompt attachments — pasted/dropped images and text files in
  `useComposerCore.ts` (`pastedImages`/`pastedFiles`, :1718-1719). The
  acceptance matrix keeps all attachments out of standalone MVP; lane 2 is
  session-scoped, so it needs an explicit context check, not a capability
  check.
- **Attachments held across a context switch are dropped, not carried**
  (review P1): hiding paste/drop/upload controls does not clear
  `pastedImages`/`pastedFiles` already held by `useComposerCore`, and
  `createNewSession` does not clear them either — files added in a
  workspace could otherwise ride into the first standalone prompt.
  Switching into a standalone draft clears held attachments with a visible
  notice, and a submit-time non-workspace guard blocks stale or
  programmatically supplied attachments from reaching a standalone session.
- Live chats get the same treatment through the same gate; PR5 already
  skips workspace providers/skills/Git/preheat for non-workspace contexts
  inside the provider, so this PR only hides the visible controls.

## Deep Links

There is no router library: `main.tsx` + `utils/sessionPath.ts` own the
`/session/<id>?workspace=<workspaceId>` scheme (`getSessionIdFromUrl` /
`getWorkspaceIdFromUrl`, `main.tsx:83-87`;
`parseSessionId`/`buildSessionPathname`), and the App reports context
upward through `onSessionIdChange` (`App.tsx:8282`) so `main.tsx` can
`replaceState` the URL.

- New standalone links carry an explicit context parameter:
  `/session/<id>?context=standalone` (no `?workspace=`). UUIDs are reserved
  daemon-wide, so a context-tagged link can never collide with a workspace
  session. Legacy context-free links keep today's workspace resolution —
  standalone sessions did not exist before this feature, so no migration is
  needed.
- **Resolution happens at the root, before the session provider mounts**
  (review P1): `main.tsx` passes the URL sessionId into
  `WorkspaceSessionProvider`, which mounts `DaemonSessionProvider` outside
  App — with no explicit context, `resolveProviderSessionContext` would
  inherit the primary workspace and start a workspace restore before any
  App-level lookup exists. The root therefore parses and validates
  `context` alongside the session id, passes the explicit context through
  `WorkspaceSessionProvider`, and for `context=standalone` suppresses
  provider session loading until exact `getStandaloneSession` lookup
  selects the route: an active summary mounts the provider with
  `{ kind: 'standalone' }`, while an **archived** summary is never loaded
  directly (review P1) — `getStandaloneSession` returns active and archived
  summaries alike, but the daemon rejects load/resume with
  `session_archived`. The flow renders the archived state, runs Unarchive,
  verifies the target id in the per-id success array, and only then mounts
  and loads. Not-found shows the existing missing-session UI
  (`connection.missingSession` → `showMissingSessionState`). It never
  guesses the primary workspace, and a cold-load test asserts zero
  workspace-load requests.
- **A `creating` lookup must reach a terminal state** (review P2): the
  resolver polls exact lookup with bounded backoff (e.g. up to 30 s, capped
  attempts) and then stops at an explicit **Retry** action; it never hangs
  in the resolving state forever.
- **Stale resolution is canceled before it starts a load** (review P1):
  the provider's generation guard only orders loads after they start, but
  exact lookup and polling happen before `loadSession`, so a delayed
  `creating` poll resolving after the user opened another session would
  start a load that incorrectly wins. A route-resolution token held by the
  root resolver (above the provider) is invalidated on every navigation and
  checked before each poll and immediately before `loadSession`.
- **Fail-closed edge cases** (review P2): a `?context=standalone` link
  carrying a conflicting `?workspace=` parameter is rejected, not
  reconciled; on a daemon without the capability, a standalone link shows
  the "requires a daemon upgrade" state instead of resolving anywhere; on a
  capable daemon whose Conversations runtime is unavailable (`503`), the
  structured error is shown with retry.
- `onSessionIdChange` becomes context-aware: standalone sessions report
  `context=standalone` and drop `workspaceId`; workspace and Live links
  keep their existing resolvers. PR5's switching semantics already
  serialize cross-context commits, so a late-arriving resolution cannot
  overwrite a newer target.

## Standalone State Surfacing

Render the typed PR5 state instead of parsing strings:

- `standaloneSession.workingDirectory.state === 'recreated'` → warning that
  the transcript survived but previous files were not recovered.
- `standaloneSession.errorCode === 'working_directory_missing'` → offer
  explicit **repair** (`repairStandaloneSessionDirectory`); repair never
  replays a prompt. This requires one small provider/App transition in PR6
  scope (review P1): today `sendPrompt`'s catch surfaces the
  prompt-admission `409` only as a generic notice and never copies its
  typed code into `standaloneSession`, and the SDK repair call neither
  clears provider error state nor reloads the session — so the Repair UI
  could neither reliably appear nor reliably unblock. PR6 captures the
  typed code into `standaloneSession.errorCode` on prompt-admission
  rejection, owner-guards Repair to the affected session, and on success
  reloads the same standalone session, clearing the error only after the
  reload commits.
- `standaloneSession.errorCode === 'working_directory_compromised'` →
  **fail-closed blocking state** (review P1): the service rejects an
  existing compromised path instead of recreating it, so no Repair action
  is offered — the user gets terminal guidance (export the transcript,
  delete the session) instead.
- `standaloneSession.creationRecovery` → a complete outcome-unknown
  recovery state machine (review P1). The provider publishes the reserved
  UUID as `connection.sessionId` without an attached session, so
  `ensureSessionForPrompt` would no-op on the existing id while submission
  fails on the empty session ref — ordinary submission and unconfirmed
  new-session actions are therefore blocked while recovery is unresolved.
  The owner-guarded **Check Status** action performs exact lookup with
  transitions for every recovery state: `creating` → bounded polling;
  `existing` → load and attach the same id, branching on `isArchived`
  first — an archived summary renders the archived state, runs Unarchive,
  verifies the per-id success array, and only then loads, because the
  daemon rejects direct loads with `session_archived` (review P1);
  `absent` → an explicit user-triggered retry (never an automatic create);
  `unknown` → a persistent recovery UI. All four transitions are tested,
  including archived summaries on both the cold-link and recovery paths.
- Delete responses carrying `fileCleanupPending` → non-blocking notice that
  file cleanup will finish automatically; the transcript is already gone.

## Compatibility and Rollout

- No daemon or SDK change; PR6 is UI-only against the merged v1 contract.
- Old daemon → legacy primary behavior everywhere; old WebShell against a
  new daemon → unchanged (it never calls standalone routes).
- Post-#9811, the provider and the product UI live in the same package, so
  no cross-package release-ordering caveat applies.

## Verification

Unit/component (vitest, `packages/web-shell`):

- Entry-point → context mapping for every row of the routing table,
  including current-session inheritance (workspace, standalone) and Live
  routing through `startLive('new')`.
- Standalone creation request body asserted exactly: no `workspaceCwd`,
  `sourceType`, `worktree`, or `branch` (review P1); workspace creation
  keeps them.
- Capability tri-state: loading creates nothing in any context;
  loaded-absent takes the legacy path with zero standalone requests
  (assertable via the e2e `mockDaemon` request log); load error fails
  closed with retry (review P1).
- Capable-daemon creation failure → error rendered, **pending standalone
  intent retained** and still authoritative for gates, no primary-workspace
  create issued (review P1).
- Recents list/rename/export/archive/unarchive/delete flows, child
  exclusion, `fileCleanupPending` removal semantics, and the standalone
  view model never exposing the internal cwd to details/navigation
  (review P2).
- Surface hiding per effective context — including the draft standalone
  chat before first prompt; uploads unavailable in standalone.
- Deep links: `creating` polls to a terminal state and stops at Retry;
  conflicting `?workspace=` + `context=standalone` rejected; incapable
  daemon shows upgrade state; not-found shows the missing-session UI
  (review P2).
- `recreated` warning, repair offered only for `working_directory_missing`,
  `working_directory_compromised` rendered fail-closed without a repair
  action (review P1), creation-recovery banner rendering from typed state.
- Prompt-admission `working_directory_missing` reaches
  `standaloneSession.errorCode`, Repair is owner-guarded to the affected
  session, and success reloads the same session and clears the error
  (review P1).
- A delayed `creating` poll canceled by a user session switch never starts
  a load (review P1).
- Context switch clears held composer attachments with a visible notice;
  the submit-time guard rejects stale or programmatic attachments
  (review P1).
- Archived standalone lane lists and refreshes after lifecycle actions;
  partial-success batch envelopes handled per action (review P2).
- Cold `context=standalone` load issues zero workspace-load requests, with
  resolution completed at the root before the provider mounts (review P1).
- Every new-session callsite passes explicit intent; no path infers intent
  from an undefined cwd or current state (review P1).
- Split View ingresses: footer entry disabled for non-workspace effective
  contexts; `?split=<standalone-id>`, sessionStorage restoration, and
  controlled-prop injection rejected or sanitized before panes mount
  (review P1).
- Outcome-unknown recovery: all four states (creating / existing / absent /
  unknown) transition correctly, ordinary submission and unconfirmed
  new-session actions are blocked while recovery is unresolved, and no
  automatic re-create ever fires (review P1).
- Archived exact-lookup summaries are never loaded directly: both the
  cold-link and outcome-recovery flows branch on `isArchived`, unarchive
  with per-id success verification, and only then load (review P1).
- Workspace→standalone draft transition isolates composer commands, skills,
  `atWorkspaceCwd`, draft, and input history with stale snapshots present
  (review P1/P2).
- Split View bare-id classifier: delayed catalogs, standalone/`creating`
  rejection, only `404` continues to workspace ownership resolution, and a
  controlled host cannot re-inject sanitized ids (review P1).
- Pending and attached standalone contexts issue zero workspace requests or
  panels (Git-status effect, `/diff`, `/log`, `/prs`, `/settings`,
  `/schedule`, `/memory`) (review P1).
- Empty standalone input history stays empty while the legacy global
  history key is populated (review P1).
- `ScheduledTasksDialog.onCreateViaChat` forces workspace intent even from
  an active standalone context (review P1).
- Standalone contexts omit the Branch action, drop `/branch` from
  discovery, and block its handler — zero generic branch requests;
  `/fork` remains available (review P1).
- Session-overview, `/resume`, `/delete`, `/release` ingresses hidden or
  blocked from pending and attached standalone contexts; `/resume <id>`
  for a standalone session routes only through the explicit standalone
  context (review P1).
- Standalone and Live contexts create no terminal WebSocket and discard
  inherited terminal tabs; workspace terminals unchanged (review P1).

E2E (Playwright, `packages/web-shell/client/e2e`):

- Extend `utils/mockDaemon.ts` scenario with a
  `standalone_sessions_v1` capability toggle and the standalone route
  family; add `web-shell.standalone.spec.ts` covering: Home New Chat →
  standalone create body asserted; project New Chat → workspace create;
  Recents lifecycle; capability loading/absent/error states; capable-daemon
  failure with retained intent.
- Manual E2E plan recorded at
  `.qwen/e2e-tests/2026-08-29-webshell-standalone-chats.md` and dry-run
  against a real `qwen serve` daemon before merge, per repo workflow.

Commands: `cd packages/web-shell && npx vitest run <file>` for focused
tests, `npm run verify` (lint + format:check + typecheck + test:ci) and
`npm run test:e2e`, then root `npm run build && npm run typecheck`.

## Scope Boundary

PR6 does not add: standalone attachments/uploads (waits on the workspace
upload follow-up), moving/forking a standalone session into a project,
durable standalone scheduling, storage quotas, or child-session management
UI. `SessionOverviewPanel` and `ResumeDialog` remain workspace-scoped in
this PR, and every ingress to them is gated (review P1): bare `/resume`,
`/delete`, and `/release` mount workspace dialogs keyed by
`lockedWorkspaceCwd`, and when it is undefined `useScopedSessions` selects
the primary WebShell catalog — so `/delete` could act on unrelated
workspace sessions from a standalone context. Non-workspace effective
contexts hide or block the sidebar `canOpenSessionsOverview` entry,
`shellApi.openSessionOverview()`, and the bare workspace dialog commands,
issuing zero legacy catalog or destructive requests; `/resume <id>` for a
standalone session routes only through the explicit standalone context.
Both pending and attached standalone states are tested. The top-level
Recents group lives in the sidebar only. Split View
stays workspace-only (context-bearing pane descriptors are a follow-up).
The one in-scope provider change is the prompt-admission error-code capture
plus repair-and-reload transition, because the Repair UI depends on it; any
other typed gap discovered in the provider surface is raised as a
follow-up. It does not change daemon lifecycle behavior, the SDK contract,
or the PR5 provider switching semantics.
