# Relaxed Standalone Daemon Ownership

## Status

Proposed for [Issue #10810](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/10810).
Once accepted, this decision supersedes the process-global cross-daemon
ownership requirement in the [standalone daemon sessions
contract](./standalone-daemon-sessions.md), which accompanies Issue #8908. All
other isolation, persistence, and lifecycle requirements remain in force. The
current implementation still enforces process-global Conversations ownership
until the source changes in this design are delivered.

This decision adopts Issue #10810's session-keyed concurrency boundary,
identity-qualified stale-writer recovery, legacy-owner migration guard, and
minimum Web Shell degradation. It corrects the issue's Live assumption: the
locator record gates publication but not activation today, so the same release
must add a Live-start publisher gate. Backend and Web Shell implementation may
land in separate pull requests, but both are required in the same release. A
proactive `activeElsewhere` listing hint remains a follow-up.

## Decision

Allow every updated `qwen serve` process to lazily create its own Conversations
runtime for the shared Conversations root after the legacy compatibility check
passes. The daemon no longer acquires a user-global process owner before serving
standalone APIs. Every standalone session instead acquires the existing
cross-process session writer lease before it can write. The lease is forced for
every writer hosted by the Conversations runtime so Live and scheduled-task
sessions cannot bypass the same-session fence.
Conversations writers and standalone lifecycle operations use a hardened local
reclaim policy that recovers only an active record proven to come from a dead
or PID-reused process in the same local identity domain: the same hostname and,
on Linux, the same boot and PID namespace. A matching live process, including a
stalled process, remains fenced.

This intentionally aligns standalone startup with ordinary workspace startup:
multiple daemons may point at the same persistent workspace, while each daemon
keeps its own ACP bridge, child process, live-session index, caches, and runtime
generation.

This is a session-partitioned concurrent-use contract, not unrestricted
multi-master support. Updated daemons may concurrently list the shared catalog,
create sessions, and host different session IDs. Competing writers and
lifecycle mutations for the same session remain serialized by that session's
writer lease. The change does not add cross-daemon routing, a shared live-state
index, atomic multi-session operations, or distributed cache invalidation.

Live activation remains a machine-global exception. Only the daemon whose PID
and instance nonce exactly match the stable Live discovery record may start or
replace a Live call. Other updated daemons may still serve standalone sessions,
but their `/live/start` and `/live/new` requests return the existing retryable
`503 conversation_runtime_in_use`; host-originated toggle and new actions are
also rejected before call activation.

## Motivation

The current user-global owner record makes the first daemon that touches
standalone or Live block standalone access from every other live daemon. A Web
Shell connected to a second daemon therefore receives
`503 conversation_runtime_in_use` even when it only needs the shared catalog, a
new chat, or a different session.

Ordinary workspaces do not impose a process-global runtime owner. The simpler
and more consistent policy is to let each daemon serve independent sessions
while the existing session writer protocol protects the actual shared-write
boundary.

## Behavioral contract

- `GET /standalone/session-options` and every `/standalone/sessions` route may
  initialize the local daemon's Conversations runtime even when another updated
  daemon process is alive.
- Another updated daemon no longer causes `conversation_runtime_in_use` on the
  standalone surface. During migration, a live legacy runtime-owner record
  still returns that error until the old daemon exits.
- If daemon A has session S loaded, daemon B may still list the shared catalog,
  create a new standalone session, and create, restore, or use a different
  session that is not held by another writer. Different session IDs may remain
  active in different daemons at the same time.
- A client remains attached to the daemon on which it created or restored an
  active session. Prompt, cancel, permission, status, heartbeat, detach, and
  SSE event routes are not forwarded to another daemon.
- Creating or restoring a standalone session acquires its session writer lease
  regardless of the user's `experimental.sessionWriterLease` setting. A second
  daemon attempting to open the same active session receives the existing
  `409 session_writer_conflict` response. Single-session rename or repair uses
  the same top-level response. Batch lifecycle routes keep their existing `200`
  result envelope but preserve any session-writer error kind in the affected
  item's `errors[]` entry. No new active-elsewhere error kind is added.
- Every other session hosted by the Conversations runtime, including Live and
  scheduled-task sessions, uses the same mandatory lease. This prevents
  background keepalive or task rehydration from silently restoring an already
  active transcript through a non-standalone source.
- Live discovery and Live activation remain single-publisher. `/live/start`,
  `/live/new`, and host-originated start actions succeed only on the daemon
  whose PID and instance nonce match the stable Live discovery record. A Live
  session on that daemon may coexist with different standalone sessions on
  another daemon. Standalone routes continue to reject Live records.
- An unsealed active lock left by a non-cooperative process exit is reclaimed
  only when the new daemon can prove that the record belongs to the same local
  identity domain and that the recorded process has exited or its PID has been
  reused. Foreign or incomplete identity remains fenced. A process with a
  matching live identity is never reclaimed based on age or inactivity.
- The lease owner is the ACP writer process, not merely its daemon parent. If a
  daemon parent dies but its child remains alive with the matching identity,
  other daemons remain fenced until that writer exits or is terminated.
- Normal switching of a persisted session to another daemon requires a
  cooperative writer handoff. An explicit per-session close or normal idle reap
  releases the lease; graceful managed-daemon shutdown seals it so the
  replacement can use the existing certified-takeover protocol. A
  non-cooperative exit is the narrow identity-qualified recovery exception.
  Both paths perform a cold restore, not hot migration.
- Daemons share persisted standalone sessions only when they resolve the same
  Conversations root and runtime base. Custom runtime bases retain the same
  storage separation they have for ordinary workspaces.
- The supported topology is several daemons on one machine under one OS user.
  Sharing the stable state base that holds the Live locator, the legacy owner
  artifacts, and the deletion journal, or sharing a runtime base that holds
  transcripts and session writer locks, across different physical machines is
  outside this contract. That boundary is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: a
  stable base reachable from more than one machine would turn the
  single-publisher Live locator from a machine-global election into a
  filesystem-global one, and the Darwin and Windows reclaim rule below carries
  no boot or namespace component to separate two hosts that share a hostname.
- Cross-process catalog changes are eventually visible through the existing
  persisted-session cache. Live state is merged only from the receiving
  daemon, so daemon B may list a session active in daemon A as persisted but
  inactive until a restore attempt returns `session_writer_conflict`. No
  cross-daemon cache or live-state invalidation is added.
- Source isolation remains unchanged. Standalone listing, restore, and lifecycle
  routes accept only top-level standalone records and continue to fail closed
  for Live-owned or otherwise foreign records.
- Concurrent background reconciliation of one deletion-journal entry is
  serialized by that session's lifecycle writer lease. A sweep that encounters
  `session_writer_conflict` treats the entry as being handled by another daemon,
  skips that UUID, and continues without converting contention into a
  compromised-record result.
- If two daemons simultaneously rehydrate the same scheduled-task-bound
  session, the mandatory writer lease admits exactly one resident session. The
  losing rehydration records the restore failure through the existing
  rehydration result and error-reporting path, then follows the existing
  keepalive backoff without firing that session's task.

Same-session exclusivity applies to the complete active-session lifetime, not
only to overlapping HTTP requests. A session that remains loaded in daemon A
cannot be continued or mutated through daemon B merely because daemon A is idle
between requests.

## Safety retained

Removing process ownership does not turn the Conversations root into an
ordinary user-selected workspace. The implementation retains:

- exact Conversations-root validation and directory identity checks;
- internal-runtime isolation and the prohibition on primary-runtime fallback;
- per-daemon runtime generation, activity drain, and terminal quarantine;
- per-session lifecycle coordination inside each daemon;
- durable standalone deletion journals and recovery checks;
- existing writer leases for lifecycle mutations;
- mandatory active-session writer leases throughout the Conversations runtime;
- identity-qualified recovery of provably stale same-domain active locks;
- the legacy runtime-owner compatibility check during migration;
- Live discovery's single-publisher record and validation;
- Live-start admission that accepts only the exact stable locator publisher.

Daemon-local create admission, live owner indexes, lifecycle coordinators,
reconciliation singleflight, and cache invalidation are not cross-process
authorities. They may make remote live state appear inactive or delay catalog
freshness, but they do not decide write ownership. A working-directory identity
pin is authoritative only while its matching local bridge session generation
remains resident, or for one lifecycle mutation after that mutation acquires
the session lease. A pin with no matching local generation is discarded before
the directory is inspected again; it cannot turn a directory safely recreated
by another daemon into `working_directory_compromised`. An identity change
while the matching generation is resident, or after a leased lifecycle
operation captures its operation-local identity, still fails closed. The
cross-process writer lease remains authoritative for each transcript and its
lifecycle, scheduled-task file mutations retain their existing cross-process
file lock, deletion reconciliation acquires the affected session's lease, and
the stable locator record remains authoritative for Live publication,
discovery, and machine-global activation, but not transcript ownership. The
contract does not promise globally fresh live state, cross-daemon event routing,
or atomic operations spanning multiple session IDs.

## Implementation

The long-lived Conversations acquire currently supplies three behavioral gates.
Removing it is complete only when every consumer has an explicit replacement:

| Consumer                                | Replacement                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standalone access to the shared runtime | No process-global gate; session writers and lifecycle operations use the mandatory writer lease            |
| Scheduled-task activation               | Mandatory writer lease for bound sessions, plus the unbound-task eligibility and binding transaction below |
| Machine-global Live activation          | Exact stable-locator publisher admission before every Live start path                                      |

The acquire's state-directory bootstrap and stable Live handoff side effects are
separately moved to the deletion journal and Live publication paths below. No
consumer continues to rely on the removed lifetime owner implicitly.

### Replace the outer owner with a legacy compatibility check

`ConversationRuntimeManager` no longer accepts a long-lived
`ConversationRuntimeOwnership` dependency and no longer calls `acquire()` in
`ensure()`. Before creating its first local Conversations runtime, it instead
invokes an inspect-only compatibility check for the legacy runtime-owner
record. Runtime creation continues to revalidate the exact root before
publishing the daemon-local managed runtime.

The compatibility check reuses the existing owner-directory identity checks,
directory lock, strict version-1 record parser, PID liveness rule, exact-record
cleanup, durability sync, and handoff grace. A valid record whose PID is still
live returns `conversation_runtime_in_use`. A valid stale record is removed
under the directory lock and rechecked before the daemon proceeds. Malformed,
unsafe, or uncertain state preserves the current compromised or unavailable
failure. The check never writes a new owner record and does not participate in
Live discovery handoff.

The check is one-shot for that daemon generation. It is not repeated after the
Conversations runtime is published and therefore cannot detect a legacy owner
record created later. This proposal accepts that limitation under the
drain-and-cutover requirement below rather than adding owner polling or runtime
read-only degradation.

`createServeApp` constructs only that compatibility checker; it does not attach
a Conversations owner to `ServeAppLifecycleController`. The lifecycle
controller therefore has no Conversations ownership to release after shutdown;
its listener, app, host, and runtime drains remain unchanged. Once legacy
versions that write the record are outside the supported upgrade window, the
inspect-only check and owner artifacts may be removed in a follow-up.

### Require the writer lease for the Conversations runtime

Force the existing writer protocol at the runtime-provenance boundary, not at
the session-source boundary. When the daemon builds a workspace runtime whose
validated provenance is `live-conversation`, its bridge adds one private,
enable-only marker to that runtime's ACP child environment. Primary, secondary,
scratch, and other ordinary workspace bridges do not receive it.

The CLI entry point captures and deletes the private marker beside the existing
private parent capability before its first await or any environment-file load.
It accepts the marker only for ACP mode, only when that capability is present,
and only at the exact enable value. A sandbox relaunch carries the accepted
marker together with the private capability through the existing private child
environment; an ordinary relaunch does not. The entry point passes the result
to `runAcpAgent` as an internal boolean rather than asking the agent to read the
mutable process environment.

`runAcpAgent` folds that boolean into the existing process-start writer
snapshot. The effective value is true when either the trusted runtime marker
was accepted or the user's startup setting enabled the lease. Per-request
settings reloads continue to use that frozen value, so one ACP process never
mixes leased and legacy writers.

The accepted marker remains an immutable Conversations-runtime provenance
signal inside the ACP process. The same captured boolean drives both mandatory
writer leasing and the scheduled-task eligibility rule below; no second
environment marker or public setting is added.

For a trusted managed child carrying the Conversations marker, `runAcpAgent`
sets `reclaimPolicy: 'local'` and keeps `takeoverPolicy: 'certified'`. Other
trusted managed workspace children keep `reclaimPolicy: 'never'`; the marker
does not relax their container-safety contract. Before the Conversations path
selects `local`, Core hardens that policy with the host, boot, and PID-namespace
checks below.

The ACP bootstrap `Config` remains recording-disabled and is not a transcript
writer. The frozen value is merged into settings before each real session's
`loadCliConfig` call. This preserves the existing restore ordering that defers
transcript projection until writer acquisition and prevents a forced lease
from being applied only after a session has already read mutable state.

The daemon's shared child-environment overrides explicitly remove the marker by
default, then the `live-conversation` bridge replaces that undefined value with
the enable value. Add the key to the existing hard-coded project-environment
exclusions so a workspace `.env` or settings reload cannot reintroduce it. The
CLI entry point also deletes the key again immediately after initial settings
and environment loading so a user-level `.env` value cannot leak to tools or
later child processes. Together these rules prevent inherited shell and
file-loaded environments from marking primary and secondary runtimes while
retaining the accepted value only in immutable local state.

This makes standalone independent of user configuration without introducing a
public setting or command-line flag. Scoping the marker to one bridge preserves
ordinary workspace behavior and also covers every source that the dedicated
runtime can host, including standalone, Live, scheduled-task controller, and
scheduled-task run sessions. A source-based override would miss background
sessions whose persisted source is not `standalone`.

The default `runQwenServe` runtime factory owns this wiring. Its per-runtime
channel factory is produced by `createSpawnChannelFactory`, which merges the
factory's second argument into the actual child environment through
`scrubChildEnv`. `createSpawnChannelFactory` marks every returned factory with
a package-owned, immutable child-environment-forwarding capability;
`defaultSpawnChannelFactory` carries the same capability because that helper
creates it. The check uses the capability, not reference equality with the
default factory, because `runQwenServe` supplies a separately configured
factory to every runtime.

`createAcpSessionBridge` derives one private immutable mandatory-lease
attestation from the conjunction of two conditions: the frozen child-environment
overrides carry the exact Conversations marker, and the selected
`channelFactory` carries the forwarding capability. Immediately before each
spawn, the bridge combines the frozen overrides with the fresh private parent
capability in the factory-argument map, so an attested factory forwards both
values to the child. A marker-shaped override map paired with an unattested
custom factory that ignores the second argument does not attest.

`ConversationRuntimeManager` includes the bridge attestation in its
owned-runtime validation before it accepts an existing registered runtime or
publishes a new candidate. A missing or false attestation is a static runtime
contract violation. A new candidate is rejected and disposed; an equivalent
existing registered runtime is terminally quarantined. The manager retains the
non-retryable `conversation_root_compromised` error as that quarantine's
terminal reason, and every later `ensure()` or current-runtime assertion
rethrows the same error instead of degrading it to retryable
`conversation_runtime_unavailable`. The runtime is never exposed to standalone,
Live, scheduled-task, lifecycle, or maintenance callers.

An embedded runtime factory supplied through `createServeApp` must either use a
factory returned by `createSpawnChannelFactory` or explicitly attest an
equivalent custom factory at the factory level through the trusted embedding
seam, then construct its bridge with the exact marker. An unattested custom
factory remains valid for ordinary bridges but fails Conversations publication;
setting `provenance: 'live-conversation'` or supplying a marker-shaped override
map alone is insufficient. A test fake may deliberately attest its factory
through the dedicated test seam without spawning a child, but publication tests
must still exercise the conjunction rather than infer it from the bridge
options' shape. This is a contract against accidental same-process miswiring,
not a security boundary against embedding code that already has authority to
construct arbitrary runtime objects.

The ACP session must acquire the lease during config initialization before it
reports successful creation or restore. It retains the lease until session
shutdown and uses the existing `session_writer_conflict`,
`session_writer_lost`, `session_transcript_changed`, and
`session_writer_unavailable` mappings.

Scope each `StandaloneSessionService` working-directory identity pin to one
locally resident bridge session generation. Use the existing
`agentBound.eventEpoch` to reuse a pin as an `expected` identity only while the
bridge still reports the same standalone session and epoch. A bare `{ pinned }`
entry left by a terminal close, an absent session after idle reap, or a
different epoch is orphaned and must be removed before restore, repair,
deletion inspection, or another maintenance path inspects the directory. A
detach that leaves the same generation resident keeps its pin. Check this
lazily before each reuse rather than adding another bridge-close callback. A
foreign session summary or an indeterminate bridge probe keeps the existing
conflict or fail-closed result; only definite local-generation absence or
replacement invalidates the old pin.

When no matching local generation remains, open and repair apply the existing
exact-root, direct-child, ownership, non-symlink, and permission checks without
the stale `expected` identity and adopt the current safe directory identity.
The ACP child must then acquire the writer lease, and the existing managed-CWD
binding and identity rechecks must still confirm that adopted identity before
restore succeeds. A lifecycle operation that closes a local session drops the
session pin, acquires the parent-side lifecycle lease, and only then captures a
fresh operation-local directory identity for any filesystem mutation. A change
to either a still-resident generation's pin or that operation-local identity
remains `working_directory_compromised`; only an orphaned daemon-local pin may
be replaced. This keeps replacement detection for live work without treating a
past daemon observation as proof against a later cooperating writer.

`StandaloneSessionService` selects the same hardened `local` policy for its
parent-side lifecycle and maintenance acquisitions, including deletion-journal
reconciliation. This lets archive, unarchive, delete, repair, and recovery make
the same stale-owner decision as the ACP writer they fence. Generic workspace
lifecycle routes and other managed runtimes keep their existing `never` policy.

The lease protects one transcript and its lifecycle. It does not coordinate
session-list reads, random-ID generation, daemon-local managed-directory state,
SSE routing, or Live discovery. Those paths keep their existing persistence,
identity, and source-isolation checks; their daemon-local observations are not
used as proof that a remote writer is absent.

The fence covers only updated, cooperating writers hosted by the marked
Conversations runtime. A legacy daemon or another process that writes the same
transcript without acquiring the protocol lease can still bypass it. The lease
is an integrity protocol, not an operating-system access-control boundary.

### Reclaim only provably stale local active writers

Strengthen the existing `local` reclaim policy before selecting it for a
managed Conversations writer. On Linux, an active schema-version-2 record adds
an optional `pid_namespace_id` beside the existing hostname and
`process_start_identity`; the latter already contains the boot ID and process
start ticks. Writers record both identities when the platform exposes them. A
reader treats an older or newly written record without either identity as live
and never automatically reclaims it.

Reuse Core's `readPidNamespaceId()`, `readLocalBootId()`, and conservative PID
liveness behavior while preserving the writer lease's existing persisted
`process_start_identity` format. `EPERM` or `EACCES` remains live; only a PID
proved absent, a validated zombie, or a readable start-identity mismatch can
support the stale verdict after the identity-domain checks pass.

An active Linux record is eligible for stale recovery only when its hostname,
boot ID, and PID namespace exactly match the contender and one of these
conditions is proven inside that namespace: the PID no longer exists, or the
PID exists with a different process-start identity. The implementation reuses
the existing reclaim guard, exact-record reread, atomic stale-record move, and
transcript verification after that verdict. It never decides from lock age,
acquisition time, heartbeat absence, or daemon responsiveness.

Darwin and Windows keep their existing platform process-start probes and
require an exact hostname and a recorded start identity for managed local
recovery. A definitely absent PID with that recorded identity is stale; a live
PID is stale only when its current start identity is readable and differs. If
an identity needed for either verdict is unavailable, and on platforms without
a supported identity probe, the record remains live for reclaim purposes. PID
reuse may therefore cause a safe false conflict but never permits an unproven
takeover.

These two platforms therefore depend on the single-machine topology stated in
the behavioral contract. With no boot or namespace component, an exact hostname
is the whole identity domain, so two hosts that share both a hostname and a
runtime base could each classify the other host's live writer as a locally
absent PID. Linux is additionally separated by boot ID and PID namespace.

A PID with a matching live start identity remains `session_writer_conflict`,
including when its event loop is stalled. Foreign-host, foreign-boot,
foreign-namespace, identity-less, malformed, non-regular, and uncertain records
remain fail closed. The `local` policy applies only to unsealed active records;
sealed records still require certified transcript takeover. Any transition
claim, including a residual one, is never reclaimed based on process liveness.

A normal per-session close removes its exact active record. Graceful managed
shutdown durably seals the record, and another managed daemon can take it over
only after verifying the transcript proof. A non-cooperative exit from a
steady active state becomes recoverable on the next qualified local
acquisition. Ambiguous transition and storage failures still require an
authoritative external writer fence before manual cleanup.

Forcing the lease also makes graceful managed shutdown seal and hash every
active Conversations transcript. The implementation does not silently lengthen
the existing child-termination deadline. Measure representative maximum
active-session and transcript sizes against that budget as a performance
observation. If the timeout ends in process death while the primary record is
still a well-formed active record, qualified-successor reclaim is the recovery
path. Delivery must still prove that timeout and cancellation do not leave a
residual claim or uncertain transition, because those states continue to fail
closed.

### Retire owner writes without removing migration or state-directory safety

The behavior change stops constructing, acquiring, and releasing a long-lived
file owner, but retains the minimal inspect-and-retire path needed for old
versions. It does not delete the remaining owner implementation and focused
tests in the same change. Keeping that code for the first patch avoids mixing
the ownership-policy change with a large cleanup. A follow-up may remove it
after the migration window has closed and the new behavior has been validated.

Move the small subset of path creation and validation logic needed by
`StandaloneDeletionJournal` into that class. Do not add a replacement
ownership service or a standalone abstraction with only this one consumer. The
journal derives its state parent directly and retains private-directory
creation, identity validation, and durability checks; it has no owner record,
process liveness check, lock, grace period, acquire, or release operation.

Preserve the existing directory-permission asymmetry when moving that logic.
On POSIX systems, the `conversations/` leaf and its journal subtree require
mode `0700`, and newly created directories use that mode. The stable state root
and any existing ancestors must still be owned, non-symlink directories whose
canonical identity remains stable, but their historical mode is not required
to be `0700` and is not changed. In particular, an existing mode-`0755`
`~/.qwen` remains valid.

`StandaloneDeletionJournal` validates that parent before entering its journal
subtree on every read, recovery, clear, and write path. Reads treat a missing
state directory as empty; the first write safely creates it. An existing unsafe
or replaced parent fails the journal operation closed, and the existing
journal-directory identity checks continue around each filesystem mutation.
This preserves the trust and bootstrap responsibilities that the old ownership
`acquire()` performed implicitly instead of accidentally making deletion
depend on Live discovery having run first.

The existing reconciliation singleflight remains daemon-local. Each journal
UUID still enters its session lifecycle lease before reading or mutating the
transcript. If a background sweep loses that acquisition to another daemon, it
skips the UUID and continues the triggering operation; it does not classify
ordinary lease contention as journal compromise. A direct lifecycle request
for that same session keeps the normal structured conflict response.

New daemons never create or replace
`conversations/runtime-owner.json`. They inspect it under the existing
`conversations/.runtime-owner.lock`: a live old-version owner keeps the current
`conversation_runtime_in_use` response, while an exactly revalidated stale
record is durably removed. The lock remains a transient guard for this
compatibility operation and is not held for the runtime lifetime.

The server retains `conversation_runtime_in_use` only for this old-version
migration case and for Live-start admission on a non-publisher. Updated daemons
do not emit it merely because another updated daemon has mounted Conversations.
`conversation_runtime_unavailable`, `conversation_root_compromised`, and
daemon-local runtime-invariant failures remain unchanged.

### Keep Live discovery separate

Keep the ownership protocol in `live/discovery.ts` unchanged. Its owner record
selects one discoverable Live host and protects publication of that endpoint;
publication alone does not currently gate activation through `/live/start`,
`/live/new`, or Host shortcut actions. Today the removed Conversations acquire
indirectly supplies that activation gate. The replacement must therefore cover
both publication and every start path.

The removed Conversations owner currently performs the stable-base discovery
handoff as a side effect of runtime acquisition, while the publication path
performs that handoff only for non-stable target bases. Move that responsibility
to the Live publication path: immediately before `writeLiveDiscoveryFile()`,
call `handoffLiveDiscoveryOwner()` for every target base, including the stable
base. Conversations runtime initialization itself no longer participates in
Live discovery ownership.

The publication path uses the existing custom-base handoff semantics for every
target: it passes a no-op `commitOwner` callback because there is no longer a
Conversations owner record to commit, and it leaves `waitForHandoffGrace` at
its default. On stale-owner reclaim, `handoffLiveDiscoveryOwner()` removes the
validated dead locator while holding the Live lock, releases that lock, and
then performs the existing handoff grace before returning. Publication then
calls `writeLiveDiscoveryFile()`, which reacquires the Live lock and rejects a
competing live publisher. The no-op deliberately removes the old cross-record
ordering dependency; the post-lock Live grace is preserved rather than moved
under the lock or retired.

A stale discovery record can therefore still be reclaimed through the existing
validated handoff before publication. An active foreign Live owner still blocks
publication, and failure to publish Live discovery does not disable standalone
routes on that daemon.

Add a read-only Live-start admission using the same stable-base directory
identity checks, lock, safe record parser, and exact owner comparison. After
awaiting publication and immediately before call activation, it rereads the
stable locator and requires the current protocol version plus a
`{ pid, instanceNonce }` match with the local daemon. It never creates,
replaces, removes, or reclaims a record. A valid different publisher maps to
the existing retryable
`conversation_runtime_in_use`; a missing or transiently unreadable locator is
`conversation_runtime_unavailable`, and malformed or unsafe state remains
non-retryable `conversation_runtime_ownership_compromised`. These failures are
Live-local and do not quarantine the Conversations runtime or disable
standalone routes.

Route-originated `/live/start` and `/live/new` requests and Host-originated
`toggle` and `new` actions must enter one asynchronous admission seam before
`LiveHostCoordinator.start()`. The HTTP routes retain their existing structured
503 serialization. A rejected Host action publishes the existing non-secret
Live unavailable/error state and must not invoke the Live session coordinator,
microphone capture, or Appshot capture. No production start caller may bypass
this seam; stop and mute remain daemon-local operations on an already admitted
call.

Because the seam is asynchronous while the Host action dispatcher and the HTTP
routes are not, a pending admission must linearize with later start-or-stop
intents. Admission captures a coordinator action generation when a start enters
the seam; every later Host `stop`, `toggle`, or `new` action and every later
`/live/start`, `/live/new`, or `/live/stop` request advances that generation,
whether or not a call exists at that moment. The seam rechecks the generation
immediately before `LiveHostCoordinator.start()` and drops a superseded start
without creating a session or activating capture: a stop that arrives while a
start admission is still pending must not be followed by a call starting when
that admission resolves. The coordinator's existing action epoch cannot express
this ordering because it advances only when a call is created, so the
generation lives beside the epoch and covers the pre-start window. The deferred
`startCall()` continuation of an admitted `start('new')` is not a separate
start caller: it carries the admission and generation captured by the
originating request, and the existing teardown and disable paths already clear
it.

Live discovery and activation remain single-publisher, while the Conversations
writer lease is session-scoped. A Live session on the elected publisher may
therefore run at the same time as a different standalone session on another
daemon. If another daemon reaches the same transcript, the writer lease rejects
it; standalone routes continue to reject Live-owned records regardless of lease
availability.

### Harden scheduled-task activation without adding another lease

Keep scheduled-task persistence, keepalive, and boot rehydration. Scheduled-task
controller and run sessions inherit the mandatory writer lease from the
Conversations runtime before restore succeeds. A daemon that loses the lease
cannot make that bound session resident; boot rehydration records the failure,
and keepalive uses its existing retry backoff.

Multiple daemons may read the same scheduled-task file and simultaneously try
to restore the same bound session while otherwise idle. Lease acquisition
occurs before that session's scheduler can activate, so exactly one restore may
become resident and fire bound tasks. The losing restore must not execute or
book the task. Its conflict is retained in the existing rehydration result and
`onError` path, not appended as a scheduled-task run. Existing cross-process
task-file mutation locking and persisted `lastFiredAt` state remain unchanged.

This prevents duplication caused solely by concurrent restore. It does not
upgrade the scheduler to exactly-once delivery: the existing at-least-once
window after a prompt is dispatched but before its fired state is durably
persisted remains unchanged, including across a subsequent owner crash.

Unbound durable tasks need a separate admission rule because two keepalive
workers may initially mint different controller session IDs, so a session
writer lease cannot elect between them yet. In the marked Conversations ACP
runtime, install a scheduler eligibility predicate before durable loading that
refuses to fire any unbound durable task. The daemon keepalive remains the only
component that binds such a task. Its existing `updateCronTasks` transaction
rechecks the unbound state under the cross-process task-file lock, commits one
controller session ID, and tears down a losing orphan. Once that binding is
visible, only the matching bound session is eligible to fire the task. Ordinary
workspace schedulers retain the existing unbound lock-owner behavior.

The default `runQwenServe` path enables the daemon-managed binding worker. An
embedded host that opts into the Conversations marker without enabling that
worker leaves unbound Conversations tasks dormant; it must not fall back to
legacy lock-owner execution. Bound tasks continue to use their recorded session
ID and the session writer lease in either host shape.

Keep the existing product boundaries: durable cron jobs remain unsupported in
standalone sessions, and generic scheduled-task routes cannot create a new
session in the Conversations workspace. This change only fences existing
background writers; it does not add standalone scheduling functionality.

### Ship minimum Web Shell degradation in the same release

Do not add an `activeElsewhere` list field or a new client-side owner-discovery
protocol. Every daemon can list persisted standalone sessions after the outer
gate is removed, while an attempt to restore a session held by another daemon
continues to return the existing `409 session_writer_conflict`.

The backend and Web Shell work may land as separate pull requests, but the
release is incomplete until the client presents the resulting states locally:

- standalone list failures and the transitional
  `conversation_runtime_in_use` response render once in the Recents section,
  not through the global error toast on every navigation-triggered refetch;
- `session_writer_conflict` and `session_writer_unavailable` from opening a
  session render on the affected row or section with a retry action rather than
  as a global toast.

An `activeElsewhere` hint remains deferred because listing has no authoritative
cross-daemon live-state index. The client reacts to the existing attach-time
error contract instead.

### Do not add routing or coordination

The change adds no daemon-to-daemon proxy, redirect, shared owner index,
heartbeat, global lifecycle lock, or distributed cache invalidation. Existing
session routes continue to resolve owners only among runtimes inside the
receiving daemon.

No new setting or command-line flag is introduced. Supporting both exclusive
and relaxed ownership modes would retain the full old subsystem and create a
mixed-mode compatibility problem without serving the requested default.

For every writer-state row, a batch lifecycle route preserves the same error
kind in its existing `200` per-item result rather than changing the batch's
transport status.

The Web Shell renders list-level failures and the transitional runtime-owner
error in the Recents section. It renders same-session writer errors on the
affected session or section with retry, without sending navigation-triggered
refetch failures through the global toast path.

## Compatibility and rollout

The REST and SDK object shapes are unchanged. The daemon batch serializer must
stop collapsing session-writer errors into
`standalone_session_operation_failed` and preserve the existing writer error
kind in the affected item's string `code`; the SDK already accepts string batch
codes. `standalone_sessions_v1` and `standalone_session_options_v1` continue to
describe API support, and no capability is added for the concurrency guarantee.

Rollout is a drain-and-cutover, not a rolling mixed-version upgrade. Stop every
daemon version that can host standalone sessions without the mandatory lease,
confirm its sessions have closed, and only then start daemons with this change.
If this order is violated in the old-to-new direction, the new daemon honors a
live legacy runtime-owner record and returns
`503 conversation_runtime_in_use`; after the old daemon exits, the next runtime
initialization removes the stale exact record and proceeds without a restart.
This compatibility guard reduces the failure mode but does not make a rolling
mixed-version deployment supported.

The compatibility check is not repeated after runtime publication, so it cannot
detect the reverse direction: an old daemon started after updated daemons have
mounted Conversations finds no owner record, writes one, and may run an
unleased ACP writer beside leased writers. All daemons sharing one Conversations
root must therefore be upgraded together. The owner-record format is not
extended with a lease-aware marker because older strict readers would reject
the new shape as compromised.

The writer-lock schema-version-2 owner record accepts the optional
`pid_namespace_id`; updated Linux writers populate it when available and
updated reclaimers require it together with the existing start identity. A
pre-existing or new active record without the complete identity is compatible
for conflict detection but cannot be reclaimed automatically. The upgrade
preflight must drain those writers or, after an authoritative external writer
fence, clear residual records explicitly. Rollback must close or drain all
updated Conversations writers and confirm that no active, sealed, claim, or
identity-extended record remains before an older non-participating daemon
starts; graceful process exit alone may intentionally leave sealed handoff
records.

Release notes must state that:

- multiple daemons may expose standalone sessions for the same user;
- active sessions are daemon-local;
- the supported topology is several daemons on one machine under one OS user;
  sharing the stable state base or a runtime base across physical machines is
  unsupported, and on Darwin and Windows the stale-writer recovery rule depends
  on that boundary;
- different session IDs may be active concurrently across updated daemons,
  while a second writer or lifecycle mutation for the same session is fenced;
- a safe working directory recreated after its local session generation exits
  is adopted on the next open, while replacement during a resident generation
  still fails closed;
- same-session conflicts reuse `session_writer_conflict`, including in the
  existing per-item error of a batch lifecycle response;
- standalone sessions always use the writer lease, even when the experimental
  setting is absent or false;
- Live and scheduled-task writers in the Conversations runtime use it as well;
- only the exact stable Live locator publisher may activate Live; another daemon
  continues to serve standalone but receives the existing 503 on Live start;
- simultaneous scheduled-task rehydration admits only one resident owner and
  does not provide exactly-once delivery beyond the scheduler's existing
  persistence semantics;
- an unbound task cannot fire from a Conversations session until the
  cross-process task-file transaction has committed its controller binding;
- standalone list and attach failures use the inline Web Shell treatment above
  instead of repeated global navigation toasts;
- a provably dead same-domain active writer is recovered automatically; on
  Linux that requires the same hostname, boot, and PID namespace, while a live
  or unverifiable writer stays fenced;
- a live old-version runtime owner present at first runtime creation still causes
  a transitional 503, but the one-shot check cannot detect an old daemon started
  later, so all daemons sharing a root require drain-and-cutover together;
- the lease provides a same-session conflict fence, not multi-master support.

## Verification

Unit tests cover server bootstrap without a long-lived legacy owner, live and
stale legacy-owner compatibility checks, strict malformed-owner failures,
runtime initialization without lifetime ownership, shutdown without owner
release, retained root/generation/quarantine failures, deletion-journal
state-parent creation and compromise detection, acceptance of a historical
non-`0700` state root alongside rejection of a non-private `conversations/`
leaf, journal bootstrap without owner acquisition, parent revalidation on
journal read/recovery/write paths, contention-as-skip during background
reconciliation, and runtime-provenance writer-lease selection.

The writer matrix covers the user setting off for a Conversations runtime, off
for an ordinary runtime, and on for all runtimes; Conversations selects
`local` while ordinary managed children retain `never`. It also covers marker
rejection without a private parent capability, capture before environment-file
loading, user-level and project-level environment scrubbing, sandbox
propagation, and isolation between primary, secondary, and Conversations bridge
child environments. Factory coverage verifies that both the default factory
and each configured factory returned by `createSpawnChannelFactory` carry the
forwarding capability and merge the bridge's second argument through
`scrubChildEnv`. Bridge-attestation coverage accepts the exact marker with such
a factory or a deliberately attested test fake, rejects the marker with an
unattested factory that ignores its second argument, and rejects a capable
factory when the marker is absent or wrong. Runtime-publication coverage accepts
the conforming Conversations bridge, rejects and disposes a non-conforming new
`live-conversation` candidate, and rejects and quarantines an equivalent
existing registered runtime while preserving non-retryable
`conversation_root_compromised` on every later access. Standalone parent
lifecycle and maintenance acquisitions must select the same `local` policy.
Scheduler coverage verifies that the captured Conversations marker installs the
unbound-durable-task skip before loading or catch-up detection, allows a task
after it is bound to that session, and leaves ordinary workspace lock-owner
behavior unchanged.

Core lease coverage records and validates the Linux PID namespace, treats a
missing reclaim identity as live, reclaims dead and PID-reused owners only in
the same hostname, boot, and namespace, and rejects matching live, stalled,
foreign-host, foreign-boot, foreign-namespace, legacy identity-less, malformed,
sealed, and residual-claim states. Darwin and Windows cover their corresponding
hostname and process-start rules. Existing concurrent-reclaimer, exact-record,
transcript-proof, and crashed-reclaimer tests remain in force.

Managed-shutdown coverage uses representative high active-session counts and
large transcripts to measure parallel sealing against the existing termination
deadline. It also verifies that a forced timeout retains the exact active lock
while the writer process is still live, never leaves a residual claim or
uncertain transition, and preserves the existing observable unclean-shutdown
outcome rather than releasing ownership ambiguously. After that exact process
exits, only a same-identity-domain contender may recover a well-formed active
record.

A two-process daemon integration test uses the same home, runtime base, and
Conversations root and verifies:

1. daemon A and daemon B both return `200` from
   `GET /standalone/session-options` and `GET /standalone/sessions`;
2. neither daemon's standalone routes return `conversation_runtime_in_use`
   merely because the other process is alive;
3. a live legacy runtime-owner record returns
   `503 conversation_runtime_in_use`, and after its process exits the next
   request retires the stale record and returns `200` without restarting;
4. while daemon A keeps standalone session S active, daemon B can still list
   the catalog, create a new chat T, and restore and use a different persisted
   session without closing S;
5. while A keeps S active, B receives `409 session_writer_conflict` when it
   tries to restore, rename, or repair S; archive and delete keep their `200`
   batch envelope and report `session_writer_conflict` for S without inventing
   a new error kind;
6. after an explicit close releases A's lease, B restores S through
   ordinary acquisition; independently, after graceful shutdown seals another
   session owned by A, B restores it through certified takeover;
7. after A closes S or S is idle-reaped, B can safely recreate its working
   directory with a new identity and release S, after which A can open, repair,
   or delete S without treating A's orphaned pin as compromise; replacing the
   directory while A's matching session generation remains resident still
   fails closed;
8. after A's lock-owning ACP writer is killed in a steady active state, B in the
   same local identity domain reclaims the lock, authoritatively reloads the
   transcript, and continues it without manual cleanup; killing only A's parent
   while that writer remains live still returns a conflict;
9. a matching live or stalled A, and records from a foreign host, boot, or PID
   namespace, remain `409 session_writer_conflict`; identity-less and residual
   claim states remain fail closed;
10. shutting down either daemon does not remove or invalidate the other's local
    runtime;
11. two otherwise idle daemons that simultaneously rehydrate the same
    scheduled-task-bound session elect one resident session through the writer
    lease; the loser records a restore failure and backs off, and only the
    winner fires the bound task for that slot;
12. two keepalive workers that observe the same unbound task may mint competing
    controller sessions, but no Conversations session fires it while unbound;
    the task-file transaction commits exactly one binding, cleans up the losing
    orphan, and only the bound controller becomes eligible to fire;
13. two daemons reconciling the same prepared deletion elect one lease holder;
    the contender skips that UUID without failing the unrelated triggering
    operation or reporting journal compromise;
14. with Live enabled on both daemons, only the exact stable locator publisher
    can activate a call: the other daemon's `/live/start`, `/live/new`, Host
    toggle, and Host new paths fail before the Live session coordinator or
    capture devices start; that daemon still serves a different standalone
    session, and standalone routes continue to reject the Live record;
15. root compromise and unavailable generations still fail closed without
    falling back to the primary workspace.

Focused `StandaloneSessionService` coverage verifies that terminal close leaves
no reusable generation pin, detach retains the same generation's pin, an
idle-reaped or replaced event epoch is discarded lazily before reuse, and
deletion reconciliation never supplies an orphaned pin. The same tests retain
`working_directory_compromised` for a replacement observed while the matching
local generation is resident and for an identity change after a leased
lifecycle operation captures its fresh identity; a foreign summary or
indeterminate bridge probe never authorizes re-pinning.

Live regression coverage verifies that Live discovery still has at most one
publisher, that the publication path performs the existing validated handoff
for the stable base as well as custom bases, and that a stale stable-base record
can be reclaimed after its previous owner exits. It verifies the no-op
`commitOwner` handoff, that the existing grace runs after the handoff lock is
released and before publication, and that a competing publisher during that
gap is rejected by the publication lock. Start-admission coverage accepts only
the current protocol version and an exact stable-locator PID and instance
nonce, rejects a valid different publisher with the existing retryable error,
and fails missing, malformed, unsafe, or unreadable locator state closed without
quarantining standalone.
Both HTTP start routes and both Host-originated start actions use the same
admission and perform no session or capture work on rejection. Admission
linearization coverage proves that a start superseded while its admission is
pending — by a later stop, toggle, or new intent through either entry family —
performs no session or capture work once that admission resolves, and only the
latest intent may activate a call. Standalone
availability remains independent of discovery publication failure and of which
daemon published the record. It also covers the elected daemon running Live
while a second Live-enabled daemon serves a different standalone session.

Web Shell regression coverage verifies that switching sessions does not emit a
toast when standalone listing fails, that a transitional
`conversation_runtime_in_use` response appears once in the Recents section,
and that `session_writer_conflict` and `session_writer_unavailable` on open are
attached to the affected session or section with a retry action. It does not
require an `activeElsewhere` list field.

Tests must prove both sides of the boundary: different session IDs can be used
concurrently across updated daemons, while the same session remains exclusive
for its complete loaded lifetime. They must not imply globally fresh live
state, cross-daemon event routing, or atomic multi-session operations.

## Rejected alternatives

- **Daemon-to-daemon proxying:** preserves a single runtime owner but requires
  authenticated forwarding for all standalone and owner-routed session APIs,
  including SSE and permissions.
- **Client redirect to the owner:** introduces discovery, token, origin, and
  reconnect behavior and keeps the global owner that this change removes.
- **Per-daemon standalone storage:** is simple but prevents daemons from seeing
  the same persisted conversation catalog.
- **Relying on the user setting for writer leases:** permits one daemon with the
  setting disabled to bypass the fence, so it cannot protect shared standalone
  persistence.
- **Enabling the lease only for `sourceType=standalone`:** misses Live and
  scheduled-task sources hosted by the same Conversations runtime, including
  background rehydration that occurs without a standalone API request.
- **Treating single-publisher discovery as an activation fence:** publication
  and activation are separate paths today. Without explicit admission before
  every start path, a client connected directly to a non-publisher daemon can
  start a second Live host despite the locator remaining single-publisher.
- **Adding `activeElsewhere` to listings now:** requires an authoritative shared
  live-state index or owner-discovery protocol. The minimum Web Shell behavior
  can use the existing attach-time error contract without adding that backend
  coordination.
- **A shared routing or global transaction plane:** daemon-to-daemon event
  routing, globally fresh live state, and atomic operations spanning sessions
  are different reliability contracts. They are unnecessary for concurrent
  use partitioned by the existing session writer lease.
- **Unqualified stale-writer reclaim:** PID, hostname, age, or inactivity alone
  cannot prove that a managed writer on shared storage is dead. Automatic
  recovery is limited to a matching local identity domain and stable process
  identity; every uncertain state remains fenced.
- **Keeping managed `never` plus manual unlock:** makes an ordinary
  non-cooperative writer death leave every loaded session unavailable until an
  operator discovers and removes internal lock files. Identity-qualified local
  recovery handles the common safe case automatically; manual recovery remains
  only for ambiguous transition or storage state after an external writer
  fence.
