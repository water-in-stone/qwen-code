# Batch 9 — OpenTUI transcript visibility (U-28, U-12, U-27, U-29, U-30)

Design doc for the batch closing the visibility gaps registered after the
Batch 8 audit. Plan announced in [#8662 (comment)](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code/issues/8662#issuecomment-5524674134).

## Problem

The OpenTUI backend keeps two histories and only one of them renders:

- `OpenTuiAppHost.history` — the ink-shaped command history. `addItem` is where
  every dispatcher write lands: the invocation echo, every `info`/`warning`/
  `error`/`success` a command returns, `goal_state`/`goal_status` cards, and
  the arbitrary items a `'history'` command outcome replays. Its only readers
  are the command context and the composer's history list — neither renders.
- `useOpenTuiLiveTurn.items` — the live transcript `renderMain` actually
  draws. It is folded from `OpenTuiStreamEvent`s only.

Consequences, all verified against the code (issue #10905 carries the full
repro):

- **U-28** — a slash command runs, takes effect, and never says so. The echo
  and its output are written to `host.history` and never displayed.
- **U-12** — mid-turn steered texts disappear from the transcript: the queue
  badge drops and the drain sends the parts to the model with no user row.
- **U-27** — no unsupported-image-format disclosure on either hop; ink adds an
  INFO row on both.
- **U-29** — discovered while designing the seam: `SessionSwitchHost` already
  documents `clearItems` as "Clears the command history AND the visible
  transcript" (session-switch.ts:55), but the implementation clears only the
  history. After `/clear`, `renderMain` keeps every live row on screen. The
  contract's second half was never implemented.
- **U-30** — found by this batch's own smoke, on the way to U-29's case: `/clear`
  threw before it cleared anything, so the only visible effect was an error row.
  Pre-existing, and in scope for the same reason as U-29. Decision 7 disposes of
  it.

## Decision 1 — one ordered model: project-on-write at `addItem`

Two options were weighed:

1. **Render `host.history` alongside the live transcript.** Two models would
   have to be interleaved in one scroll, with a merge/dedupe story for the
   user rows both sides carry (composer submits never touch `host.history`;
   command echoes exist only there). Rejected: the interleaving is exactly the
   state the migration has avoided owning twice.
2. **Project at write time (chosen).** `host.addItem` converts each item it
   actually records into an `OpenTuiStreamEvent` and appends it to the live
   transcript through the existing transcript seam. One ordered model, no
   merge. This works because of three verified lifecycle facts: live items
   persist across turns (only `resetTranscript`/`foldBatch` replaces them),
   the host is the stable external store the dispatcher writes through, and
   `/resume`/`/branch` already replace the transcript wholesale _after_
   `loadHistory`, so replay order matches ink's single-history order.

Leaning announced in the plan comment; this doc pins it.

## Decision 2 — the seam grows to `{ reset, clear, append }`

`OpenTuiTranscriptController` (opentui-host.ts:64-67) is `{ reset(events) }`.
It becomes:

```ts
interface OpenTuiTranscriptController {
  reset(events: OpenTuiStreamEvent[]): void; // replay (single commit)
  clear(): void; // /clear, /reset, /new (U-29)
  append(event: OpenTuiStreamEvent): void; // one projected item (U-28)
}
```

- The shell implements `append` over a new `onTranscriptEvent` prop, which the
  entry wires to `live.applyEvent`; `clear` reuses the existing
  `onTranscriptReset` with an empty batch (an empty fold is a fresh list), so
  no second reset path is added. Absent prop → no-op, matching how
  `onTranscriptReset` already degrades in tests.
- Adding a dep to the `transcript` memo does not destabilise the host built from
  it: both callbacks are referentially stable (`apply` is a `useCallback` with no
  deps, `resetTranscript` depends only on the equally stable `setBusy`), so the
  memo — and the `host` memo that consumes it — keep one identity per session.
  A churning host would drop `host.history` and rebuild the dispatcher on every
  render, which is the failure this check rules out.
- `host.clearItems` calls `transcript.clear()` — this is U-29's fix, and it
  completes the contract comment that already promised it.
- `host.loadHistory` does **not** project: it is a replace operation and both
  `/resume` and `/branch` call `resetTranscript` immediately after it, which
  owns the visible result.
- `host.updateItem` does **not** project. Its one caller flips
  `sentToModel` on the invocation echo; `UserRow` ignores that flag, and the
  live model has no update-by-id, so re-projecting would duplicate the row.

## Decision 3 — the projection table is total, not best-effort

The plan comment commits to "nothing falls through silently". That is made
structural: the projector is a `switch` over `item.type` whose `default`
arm assigns the item to `const exhaustive: never`, so adding a history
kind without deciding its transcript fate is a compile error (the
transcript-view house pattern). The mapping:

| HistoryItem kind                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Projection                           | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Four of the latter **are written here**: `/advisor` adds an `advisor` item directly (advisor-command.ts:221-224), `/arena start` writes `arena_agent_complete` and `arena_session_complete` from its event handlers (arenaCommand.ts:322,335), and `/recap` writes `away_recap` whenever `executionMode` is `interactive` (recapCommand.ts:63-69) — which the OpenTUI command context always sets (commands-context.ts:119). Their output is invisible after this batch exactly as it was before; that is registered as U-34 rather than claimed fixed. Each kind is named so the gap is a decision, not an accident |

The projector lives next to `projectSpecialItemText` in `item-projection.ts`
so the kind knowledge stays in one file.

## Decision 4 — U-12: echo at the drain, per surviving message

ink pins the semantics (use-llm-stream.ts:3349-3368): `accept()` adds a
`USER` item with `sentToModel: false` for each message that survived
resolution, at accept time — after the read cards/notices, and nothing for
messages dropped by a decline or restored by an abort (the whole hop restores
all-or-none).

Port:

- The echo rides `SteeredPromptResolution.events` rather than a separate
  channel. A first cut carried `echoes: string[]` alongside `events` and the
  drain yielded all events then all echoes; the audit caught that this groups
  the rows, while ink's `accept()` runs each message's side effects and then
  adds _that_ message's `USER` row — so a two-message steer reads
  cards₁ row₁ cards₂ row₂ there, and cards₁ cards₂ row₁ row₂ under the first
  cut. One ordered list removes the divergence and the extra field.
  `renders each steered message with its own cards before its own echo` pins
  it; measured — restoring the grouped order turns exactly that test red and
  leaves the two pre-existing echo tests green.
- Echo text is the raw queued message, not the expanded parts, as in ink.
- The existing all-or-none restore path is untouched: `restore()` returns an
  empty event list, so a restored hop yields no echo and no cards, under the
  Batch 8 divergence already documented on `resolveSteeredPromptParts`.
- Residual divergence, narrowed by the audit. `accept()` echoes every message it
  recorded, so the echo must not be coupled to that message's own parts — the
  first cut coupled them, and the audit found ink's caller drops the _whole_ hop
  when the joined parts come out empty (use-llm-stream.ts:3394), a guard this
  drain does not model. Three cases, for a batch of steered messages: all
  resolve to content (both ports echo all — the common case), a mix of empty and
  non-empty (ink echoes all; the coupled cut echoed only the non-empty ones, so
  a steered message vanished — the exact defect U-12 exists to remove), and all
  empty (ink echoes none; the port echoes all). The shipped shape decouples the
  echo, matching ink in the first two and over-showing only in the third. Not
  porting the guard is deliberate: reaching the third case needs every message
  to resolve to an empty part list, and this drain already emits accept-gated
  read cards unconditionally, so gating the echo alone would be inconsistent
  with the hop it rides. `echoes a steer whose expansion resolved to no parts`
  pins the decoupling; measured — re-coupling it turns exactly that test red and
  leaves the other 41 in the file green.

## Decision 5 — U-27: format check at both hop exits

ink's shape (use-llm-stream.ts:322-371, :3316-3327, :3834-3850): a
`checkImageFormatsSupport(parts)` helper runs after the request parts are
final, on both hops, and an INFO item with
`getUnsupportedImageFormatWarning()` lists the formats the pipeline supports.
Two ink facts kept exactly:

- The check uses the wide acceptance list (`isSupportedImageMimeType`) while
  the warning text lists the narrower pipeline set — a core-semantics quirk
  ported as-is, not "fixed" here.
- The fresh hop checks only `UserQuery`-type submits, not tool-result
  continuations; so in `livePromptEvents` the check runs once, on the initial
  `nextPrompt` after the bridge, not inside the send loop. No submit-type guard
  is ported because ink's `UserQuery | Cron | Teammate` condition is satisfied
  by construction here: the OpenTUI live turn has no Cron/Teammate/Goal submit
  path, its fresh hop is always `SendMessageType.UserQuery` (live-session.ts:638)
  and its continuations are `ToolResult` (:645), which the check sits outside of.

Port:

- `checkImageFormatsSupport` is ported as a private helper in
  `live-session.ts` (it is private in ink too; extracting a shared module
  would touch the ink hook for no shared behavior). The port is narrowed to
  `hasUnsupportedImageFormat(parts): boolean`: ink's version also returns
  `hasImages` and the offending mime list, and no caller reads either — in ink
  or here — so carrying them would add two dead fields to the diff.
- Fresh hop: after `nextPrompt = bridged.parts`, before the send loop.
- Steering hop: inside `resolveSteeredPromptParts`, after the bridge, per
  surviving message — following the Batch 8 convention that this hop's events
  are produced as they are produced.
- The event rides the existing `{type: 'info'}` channel (precedent: the
  bridge's own egress notice).

## Decision 6 — Batch 8 design-doc corrections ride the first commit

Two wording errors in `2026-09-03-opentui-batch8-submit-exit-parity.md`,
found while writing this doc:

1. The U-26 gap section says "Registered as U-26" — U-26 was retired the same
   day and folded into U-12 (ledger re-confirmation). The section now
   references U-12 as the authoritative record.
2. The U-27 section says ink "names the formats the model cannot read" — ink
   names the formats the pipeline **supports**. The sentence is corrected so
   this batch's port is not "fixing" a claim that was never true.

## Decision 7 — `/clear`'s detached host method (U-30, found by the smoke)

The first OpenTUI smoke of this batch threw before it cleared anything:

```
✖︎ undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.deps.startNewSession')
```

`clearCommand` re-keys the session (`context.session.startNewSession(id)`)
_before_ it calls `context.ui.clear()`, and `commands-context.ts` handed the
host's prototype method out as a bare reference — so `this` was the context's
`session` object and `this.deps` was undefined. The transcript stayed on
screen: U-29's own acceptance case was unreachable end to end.

Pre-existing (this batch does not otherwise touch that wiring) but in scope,
because the batch's claim is "a command's effect is visible" and this is a
command whose visible effect was an error row. Fixed by binding the receiver at
the seam (`host.startNewSession?.bind(host)`) rather than by making the host
method receiver-free, which would leave the same trap for every other method
the context hands out. The regression test's fake host uses a shorthand method
that reads `this`, so a detached reference fails there too. Measured — dropping
the `bind` turns exactly that test red with `TypeError: Cannot read properties
of undefined (reading 'push')` and leaves the file's other six green.

The mechanism was swept, not just the instance: every other `session`/`ui`/
`extension` entry the context hands out is an arrow wrapper closing over `host`
or a plain data field, so the fixed line was the only detached host-method
reference in `ui/opentui/`. The hook-provided `startNewSession` the entry passes
down is a `useCallback` closure, which is safe to destructure.

Worth recording that the row was readable at all only because U-28 now projects
dispatcher writes; before this batch the failure would have been silent, with
`/clear` simply appearing to do nothing.

## Decision 8 — one user row per command submit

Project-on-write made the recorded invocation echo visible, which exposed a
second row behind every `submit_prompt` outcome: the live turn echoed the
_expanded_ content — a skill prompt the user never typed. ink adds only the
invocation row: its `submit_prompt` case returns before the USER `addItem`
(use-llm-stream.ts:1607 vs :1683). Suppressed at the seam rather than in the
projection, because the seam is where "this submit came from a command" is
known: `submit()` takes `invocationEchoed`, the shell sets it for
`submit_prompt` outcomes only, and a typed prompt keeps its echo. Measured —
dropping the guard adds the row back and reddens the live-turn case, and the
shell cases pin that the flag travels with the per-turn options.

## Decision 9 — duplicate steers collapse at the fold

Steering the same text twice in a row rendered two rows where ink renders one.
ink suppresses a user item identical to its predecessor inside `addItem`
(useHistoryManager.ts:84-95), and this renderer's host copies that condition —
but stream echoes never pass through either `addItem`: they reach the
transcript through `foldLiveEvent`. The collapse therefore goes in the fold's
user arm, the one chokepoint the projected echo and the live echo share, keyed
on consecutive-identical text only. A no-op fold returns `prev`, so a dropped
echo does not even re-render the transcript. Measured — deleting the condition
folds two rows (`expected [ …(2) ] to have a length of 1 but got 2`) while the
`['first', 'second']` cases stay green, so the key is not over-broad.

## Coverage boundary

- **Unit (projection)**: the total table is the compile-time guard; tests pin
  the row-producing mappings (echo, notices with link footer, goal pair, hook
  texts, a `projectSpecialItemText` delegation), the `clear` wiring, and that
  `updateItem`/`loadHistory` do not append.
- **Unit (U-12)**: fake-client drain tests asserting echo events for surviving
  texts, no echo on abort/restore or on a declined expansion, echo-after-cards
  order for one message, and per-message interleaving for two.
- **Unit (U-27)**: unsupported-mime part on each hop yields exactly one info
  event listing supported formats; supported/absent images yield none. The fresh
  hop pins placement and not just presence: the stream mock records at call time
  whether the disclosure has already been yielded, so the row is proven to
  precede the request. Measured — moving the check to just after
  `client.sendMessageStream(...)` turns exactly that test red
  (`expected false to be true`) and leaves the other 41 in the file green; the
  presence-only assertion it replaces did not catch that move.
- **Unit (U-27, second round)**: a `fileData` image is disclosed like an
  `inlineData` one — deleting that branch reddens exactly the new case
  (`expected [] to deeply equal [ { type: 'info', …(1) } ]`) and had left the
  first round's 42 green. The steering disclosure is attributed per message:
  one warning between the two echoes, and hoisting the check above the loop
  moves it after both (`expected 8 to be greater than 9`).
- **Unit (projection content)**: the blocked-prompt row asserts ink's text and
  the redaction rather than its kind alone — dropping the reason at the
  projection site reddens that case while the formatter's own redaction test
  stays green, which is the distinction the assertion buys. The stats row is
  pinned to the context the host forwards: with `stats` unset it collapses to
  the context-free fallback, and the case fails on the missing `Session ID`.
- **Unit (host identity)**: the shell builds one host, and one dispatcher,
  across five renders, and the live turn's transcript seam callbacks keep their
  identity across turn state. Removing the transcript memo produces 5 dispatcher
  constructions (`expected 5 to be 1`); giving `apply` a dependency reddens the
  seam case. Before the identity case existed, the same memo removal passed 30
  of the shell's 32 tests: the only other failure was the composer-history case,
  which trips over the lost history rather than the churn itself.
- **E2E**: the harness does have a screen-text channel —
  `InteractiveSession.screen()`/`waitForScreen()` reconstruct the rendered
  screen through `@xterm/headless` (interactive-session.ts:182-217), and the
  session honours the renderer matrix, so a spec built on it runs on both legs.
  An earlier draft of this doc declared that channel nonexistent; the claim was
  wrong, and correcting it changed what this batch could honestly claim.
  - `interactive/command-output-visibility.test.ts` (new) pins U-28's headline:
    `/about` puts a field label on the rendered screen that the boot screen
    does not contain, and the model is never called, so the row can only have
    come from the command. Measured 1:1 — with the projection's
    `transcript.append` neutered (`append: () => {}` in
    opentui-app-shell.tsx:259), the OpenTUI leg exits 1 after 69.49 s across
    vitest's 3 attempts and the ink leg exits 0. The failure surfaces from the
    re-send helper below (spec:51), not from a generic timeout, and the failing
    screen dump is the OpenTUI composer — independent evidence the leg ran
    OpenTUI. The matrix also pins `QWEN_TUI_RENDERER_STRICT`, so a silent ink
    fallback would fail the boot rather than pass as a false green.
  - **The ink leg needed a bounded re-send, and the reason is not this batch.**
    `InteractiveSession.start()` waits only for the composer placeholder
    (interactive-session.ts:128), and ink loads the slash-command registry in an
    async effect that gates nothing (slashCommandProcessor.ts:759), so a command
    sent the moment the prompt appears can land on an empty registry and print
    `Unknown command: /about`. It did, 3/3 attempts, once a parallel spec file
    was booting a second CLI; the spec alone passed in 5.1 s. No readiness signal
    exists to wait for on either leg: `(shift + tab to cycle)` is ink's
    approval-mode suffix and OpenTUI deliberately does not render it
    (input-prompt.tsx:1096), and the footer's `Initializing...` tracks
    `isConfigInitialized`, not the registry (useConfigInitMessage.ts:53).
    OpenTUI covers itself by reloading the registry and re-parsing whenever
    nothing matched (commands-dispatch.ts:471), which is why the same send
    renders there. So the spec waits for _either_ the row or ink's unknown-command
    text and re-sends on the latter, inside a 90 s window. The wait stays
    discriminating: a projection regression produces neither string, so
    `waitForScreen` throws and leaves the loop instead of spinning it — that is
    the mutation measurement above. The recovery branch is measured too, not
    inferred: forcing the first send to miss (a temporary `/about-not-a-command`
    probe, since reverted) made the ink leg log one unknown-command iteration and
    then render the row on the second send, green in 8.6 s — the loop recovers
    rather than spins, and ink's unknown-command text is treated as "not yet"
    rather than as success. In the shipping runs the race did not fire: ink
    rendered on the first send in 5.17 s alone and 8.89 s inside the two-spec
    gate run, OpenTUI in 5.28 s. All three measurements are transcribed in
    `.qwen/e2e-tests/2026-09-03-opentui-batch9-command-visibility.md`.
  - The mid-turn spec still covers the drain path end-to-end (4/4 green in CI
    on main as of run 33740217426). U-12's echo rides that path, but no case
    asserts the echo row: that spec reads request bodies, and an echo is a
    transcript row, not a request.
  - Unasserted in CI: U-29 and U-27. `screen()` returns the whole xterm buffer
    including scrollback, so "the row is gone after `/clear`" is not
    expressible through it — U-29 rests on the unit wiring plus the local smoke
    below. U-27 would need an unsupported image inside a submitted prompt,
    which the fake server's scripted turns do not model.
  - **When it runs**: three lanes collect it. `e2e-interactive-opentui`
    (e2e.yml:528) runs it under the opentui renderer, and the ink lanes —
    `e2e-test-linux`, every shard (e2e.yml:349, :352), and `e2e-test-macos`
    (e2e.yml:457) — pass `--root ./integration-tests` with exactly two
    excludes (`**/interactive/cron-interactive.test.ts` and
    `**/channel-plugin.test.ts`), so they collect this spec under ink too.
    None of the three is pre-merge evidence: `e2e.yml` never triggers on
    `pull_request` — only pushes to `main`, the nightly schedule, and
    `workflow_dispatch` (its own comment gives the reason: E2E is slow and
    flaky, so it stays out of the merge queue). Pre-merge the evidence is
    therefore local, plus one manual dispatch against this branch
    (run 33830499451), whose result is recorded on the review thread that
    raised this rather than asserted here.
- **Adjacent finding, not fixed here**: no OpenTUI path calls
  `recordMidTurnUserMessage`. ink records each steered message to the chat log
  inside `accept()` (use-llm-stream.ts:3352-3358) and the ACP session does the
  same; a grep over `packages/` finds those two callers and none under
  `ui/opentui/`. So U-12 makes a steer visible without making it durable — a
  session resumed from the recording would not contain it. Recording is a
  different seam from the transcript and was not measured here, so it is
  registered as a follow-up rather than folded in.
- **Adjacent finding, not fixed here**: `external-context-mem0-write.test.ts`
  spawns its own PTY without the renderer matrix, so on the OpenTUI leg it
  exercises ink — a false green inside the gating leg, and the only interactive
  spec that self-spawns. Wiring it up may well turn it red for reasons unrelated
  to this batch (it has never actually run under OpenTUI), so it is registered
  as a follow-up instead of being folded in.
- **Adjacent finding, not fixed here**: OpenTUI's help overlay advertises `!` as
  "Run shell commands" (help-content.ts:70), but nothing under `ui/opentui/`
  implements a shell mode — no `!`-prefix handling, no shell-command processor,
  so a `!ls` submission is handed to the model as text. That is also why
  `user_shell` is correctly a projection no-op: its only producer is ink's
  `shellCommandProcessor` (shellCommandProcessor.ts:100). Registered rather than
  folded in — closing it means either implementing bash mode or correcting the
  help list, and neither is a transcript-visibility decision.
- **Adjacent finding, not fixed here**: four kinds ink renders through dedicated
  components are written under this renderer too, and stay invisible.
  `/advisor` writes an `advisor` item straight through `ui.addItem`
  (advisor-command.ts:221-224), `/arena start` writes `arena_agent_complete` and
  `arena_session_complete` from its emitter handlers (arenaCommand.ts:322,335),
  and `/recap` writes `away_recap` whenever `executionMode` is `interactive`
  (recapCommand.ts:63-69) — which the OpenTUI command context always sets
  (commands-context.ts:119). They are one follow-up rather than four quick
  projections: each needs a row shape this transcript does not have, and arena's
  items carry structured agent-card data with no text field at all. Projecting
  the two text-only ones as bare info rows now would pre-empt that design and
  have to be undone by it. The replay path had the same hole first —
  `resumeEventsFromSession` never mentions these kinds either — so leaving all
  four out keeps live and replay consistent. Registered as U-34.
- **Local interactive smoke** (measured against the final bundle, OpenTUI +
  strict): `/about` renders the full projected status block, including the
  `Memory Usage` field the new spec waits on; `/clear` then empties the
  transcript, leaving only the composer (4 non-blank pane lines) and no error
  row — the Decision 7 symptom is gone. The mid-turn steer echo was not smoked:
  holding a stream open needs a scripted turn, and the unit drain test is the
  evidence there.
