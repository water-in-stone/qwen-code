## Problem

Session PR bindings record which pull requests a session produced, as a
`<sessionId>.pr.json` sidecar (`packages/core/src/services/session-pr-service.ts`).
Manual binding — the REST `PATCH …/session/:id/metadata` routes and the ACP
`session/update_metadata` method — is platform-neutral: it accepts any
positive integer `number` plus any http(s) `url`, so an Aone codereview URL
can be bound today.

The two AUTOMATIC paths are GitHub-only:

1. **Backfill** (`packages/cli/src/serve/routes/session-pr-backfill.ts`,
   `POST /sessions/backfill-prs`): maps session branches to PRs via one
   `gh pr list --state all` per workspace, and resolves the `pr-<N>`
   worktree slug/branch convention's number to a URL through gh, falling back
   to `<origin web URL>/pull/<N>`. On an Aone workspace, `gh` fails against
   the non-GitHub remote, and the fallback fabricates a
   `https://gitlab.alibaba-inc.com/<g>/<p>/pull/<N>` URL — a page that does
   not exist (Aone CR pages live at `…/codereview/<global-id>` on the WEB
   host `code.alibaba-inc.com`).
2. **State refresh** (`packages/cli/src/serve/server/session-pr-refresh.ts`):
   a 5-minute daemon sweep that keeps each binding's `state` snapshot
   (open/merged/closed badge) fresh via `gh pr list --state all`. An Aone
   binding's number never appears in gh's page, so its state is frozen at
   bind time forever.

Goal: Aone workspaces get the same automatic binding and state refresh as
GitHub workspaces — first-class, not manual-only.

Reusable Aone primitives from the review subsystem (both dependency-light):

- `packages/cli/src/commands/review/lib/remote-match.ts` (zero imports):
  `parseRemoteUrl` (https/ssh/scp → `{host, owner, repo, groupPath}`) and
  `isAoneCanonicalHost` (the canonical web/git pair only).
- `packages/cli/src/commands/review/lib/platform/aone-client.ts`:
  `A1_MIN_VERSION` (0.1.90) and `parseA1Version`. (Its exec transport is NOT
  reused — see below.)

NOT reused: `registry.ts`'s `detectPlatformKind` — its no-signal branch probes
`process.cwd()`, which is wrong for a multi-workspace daemon; serve reads the
origin per workspace and applies the same canonical-only predicate review
uses for explicit coordinates.

## Design

### Detection — per workspace, origin-based, canonical-only

Each backfill run / refresh sweep resolves the workspace's platform from its
OWN origin: `git remote get-url origin` at the workspace git root (async
`execFile`, env sanitized through core's `gitEnv` like every sibling git call
in these paths), parsed by review's `parseRemoteUrl`, gated by
`isAoneCanonicalHost`. Undefined host / unreadable origin / non-canonical
host → GitHub path (today's behavior).

The gate is CANONICAL-only (not the `*.alibaba-inc.com` family): that suffix
also names GitHub Enterprise instances, and a family match would displace a
GHE workspace onto a1 — before this feature `gh` served it (resolving the
enterprise host from the origin), while a1 would either fail every read
(state frozen forever) or, when a same-path repo exists on real Aone, serve
an unrelated repo's same-numbered MR. The workspace origin is an explicit
coordinate in review's sense, so its rule applies.

### New module: `packages/cli/src/serve/server/aone-mrs.ts`

Async a1 transport + the three operations the binding paths need. Collocated
test `aone-mrs.test.ts`.

- **Runner**: `execFile` (promisified), no shell, `--format json` appended,
  20s timeout, 16MB maxBuffer, `windowsHide`. The review `aone-client.ts`
  transport is deliberately not reused: it is `execFileSync` (blocks the
  daemon event loop), sleeps via `Atomics.wait`, retries twice with 3s/6s
  blocking backoff against a 120s timeout (worst case ~6 min per call —
  wrong for a 5-minute timer and an HTTP route), and exposes no env/cwd
  options. The daemon re-attempts on the next sweep/run instead; one failed
  call must cost one timeout, not six minutes. Parsed output is checked for
  the `a1.error/v1` shape before use — a1 answers some errors that way at
  exit 0 and others at exit 1 with the same object on stdout.
- **Version floor**: `a1 --version` before the first read; a POSITIVE probe
  is memoized per daemon process, while a missing or too-old a1 keeps
  re-checking so installing/upgrading it takes effect without a restart.
  Below the review-subsystem's `A1_MIN_VERSION` → unavailable with the
  upgrade remedy in the message.
- **Failure contract** (as shipped): detection returns `undefined` for a
  non-Aone workspace, and reads throw `AoneCliUnavailableError` /
  `AoneCommandError`, which both consumers catch and degrade in place
  (skip branch mapping, leave a number unresolved, keep a binding's last
  state) — the same degrade-in-place behavior the gh path gets from its
  `not_a_repo / cli_unavailable / failed` unions.
- Exports:
  - `resolveAoneWorkspaceRepo(workspaceCwd, env?) →
Promise<{ repoPath: string } | undefined>` — detection + coordinate in
    one git call; `undefined` = not an Aone workspace (or not a repo).
  - `listAoneMergeRequests(repoPath, { state, pages }) →
Promise<Array<{ number, headRefName, state }>>` — sequential pages of 20,
    stopping at a short page.
  - `viewAoneMergeRequest(repoPath, id) →
Promise<{ number, url, state }>` — `url` = `detailUrl`.
  - State mapping: `merged` → `merged`; `closed` → `closed`; anything else
    (`opened`, `reopened`, `accepted`) → `open`. No `draft` variant exists in
    the sidecar (same as gh's mapping).

Test injection: `backfillWorkspaceSessionPrs` and
`refreshWorkspaceSessionPrStates` gain an optional `aoneBackend` in their
options object (the gh fetcher's positional injection stays as-is, so every
existing test keeps compiling). The backend interface is the two functions
above; tests substitute fakes.

### Backfill changes (`session-pr-backfill.ts`)

> Updated with #9739: backfill's sources are the `/review <N|#N|url>`
> commands the user typed and the worktree `pr-<N>` convention — on EVERY
> platform. Transcript-branch mapping was removed as measured noise on
> GitHub and is not reintroduced for Aone, so `a1 repo mr list` is no
> longer on backfill's call path (`listAoneMergeRequests` stays as the
> exec-layer primitive; the injected `AoneMrBackend` seam is view-only).

Per workspace, after candidate collection:

- GitHub workspace → exactly today's code path.
- Aone workspace:
  - Candidates: sessions with a `/review` command or a `pr-<N>` worktree
    sidecar, plus — Aone only — any session already holding a PR sidecar,
    so the legacy repair below reaches bindings whose worktree sidecar is
    gone.
  - URL resolution: NEVER fabricate. Every planned number (`/review`
    numbers and the convention number) that is newly bound this run is
    resolved through `viewAoneMergeRequest` (the only sanctioned URL
    source), capped at `AONE_MAX_MR_VIEW_CALLS_PER_RUN` = 25 unique numbers
    (the same constant bounds the refresh sweep); the excess counts as
    `unresolved` and the next run retries it. `/review <url>` forms only
    recognise `/pull/<N>` URLs, so Aone `codereview/<id>` links are not a
    form source (a bare `/review <id>` is); the only `/pull/<N>` form an
    Aone workspace can see is the fabricated own-remote shape, which is
    admitted on a FULL-path match (the two-segment repo key collapses
    nested groups) and supplies the number only — never the URL.
  - Same-PR identity on Aone fails CLOSED: an existing entry passes the
    guard only when it is provably one of this repo's own MRs — either
    mr-view-attested this run, or matching the exact detailUrl SHAPE for
    this repoPath (`isAoneDetailUrlForRepo`). The shape deliberately mirrors
    the sidecar WRITE path (`updateSessionPrStates` matches by exact
    `canonicalSessionPrUrl` equality, which preserves scheme/host/port): an
    entry counts as own/refreshable only if a fetched detailUrl would
    actually LAND on it. So the shape is the WEB-host, `https`, port-less
    spelling a1 produces — a binding in any other spelling (the git host,
    `http:`, an explicit port) is one the write path would also refuse, and
    is left foreign-and-kept here rather than viewed to no effect. The
    shape is exact because repoPath is the origin's full group path (no
    collapse), and it is what keeps a full sidecar's re-planned entries
    trimmable WITHOUT spending the view budget re-attesting them every run
    — re-attestation leaked the whole budget in steady state. Anything
    unprovable stays foreign and kept; the gh path keeps its fail-open
    default.
  - Legacy repair: bindings the pre-Aone backfill persisted in the fabricated
    `<origin web URL>/pull/<N>` shape are detected and re-resolved through
    the same capped view path, then rewritten in place with the real
    `detailUrl` + state (createdAt preserved). Without this they can never
    match a fetched URL — frozen state and one wasted view call per refresh
    sweep, forever.
  - A failed `mr view` leaves that number unresolved; the remote web URL
    - `/pull/<N>` fallback applies to GitHub only.
- Response shape (wire): one additive field — `platform: 'github' | 'aone'`
  per workspace result; `ghAvailable` is reported on GitHub only.

### Refresh changes (`session-pr-refresh.ts`)

Per workspace, after pending-number collection (unchanged):

- GitHub workspace → exactly today's code path.
- Aone workspace: drop numbers whose every stored URL misses this repo's
  detailUrl shape — foreign manual bindings, legacy fabricated entries
  awaiting backfill repair, another repo's same-numbered MR can never match
  an attested `detailUrl`, so viewing them would only burn capped slots,
  every sweep, forever. Dedupe the remainder ACROSS sessions (a global id
  bound by several sessions costs one call), then `viewAoneMergeRequest`
  per unique number.
- The view window is capped at `AONE_MAX_MR_VIEW_CALLS_PER_RUN` = 25 and
  ROTATES: the timer keeps a per-workspace start offset and advances it each
  sweep by however many views the sweep actually STARTED (`aoneConsumed`,
  reported in the sweep result), not the fixed cap. Advancing by the cap
  would, when the aggregate budget truncates a sweep, leave the truncated
  tail in the gap between consecutive windows forever; advancing by the
  consumed count tiles windows contiguously. Either way a refreshable set
  larger than the cap is fully refreshed over consecutive sweeps instead of
  starving a fixed prefix. The timer prunes a removed workspace's offset
  each tick (the daemon runs indefinitely, so an entry per ever-seen cwd
  would otherwise grow without bound).
- The loop also has an AGGREGATE time budget (`AONE_SWEEP_VIEW_BUDGET_MS`
  = 60s): per-call timeouts bound one view, but 25 sequential hung views
  would outrun the sweep interval and — via the timer's re-entrancy guard —
  pause every workspace's refresh. Past the budget the loop stops STARTING
  views; the remainder degrades like a per-number failure and the rotation
  retries it.
- The fetched `detailUrl` is re-validated against the sidecar's own URL
  invariants before it is trusted (`parseAoneMrView`): a detailUrl longer
  than `SESSION_PR_URL_MAX_LENGTH` or carrying a control character is
  refused, because persisting either would make `readSessionPrs` reject the
  ENTIRE list — one malformed a1 answer would void all of the session's
  bindings. The view then degrades to "unresolved this run".
- Successful views feed the existing `updateSessionPrStates` write path
  keyed by `{state, url: detailUrl}` — its canonical-URL identity check
  keeps working because `detailUrl` is the canonical form of a bound Aone
  URL. Per-number errors (403/404/timeout) skip that entry; the sweep
  continues.
- Only non-`merged` entries are swept today; that stays. Closed MRs are not
  listable via a1, so a binding whose MR was closed keeps its last state —
  but a reopened MR appears under `--state opened` and self-heals.

### Environment

a1 takes no env parameter (review precedent: it inherits `process.env` and
authenticates through its own `a1 auth login` config; there is no `A1_TOKEN`
convention). The git calls added here ride `gitEnv(runtime.env.effectiveEnv)`
like their siblings.

`packages/core` is untouched. Imports from
`packages/cli/src/commands/review/lib/` are dependency-light modules
(`remote-match.ts` has zero imports; `aone-client.ts` only `node:child_process`),
and serve → commands imports have precedent (the channel modules).

## Non-goals

- Web Shell `/prs` glance panel and PR creation dialog
  (`workspace_github_prs` capability, `workspace-github-prs.ts`): a separate
  feature with its own CI-rollup/review-decision fields.
- Creating MRs on Aone from the Git dialog.
- Detecting CLOSED Aone MRs (a1 cannot list them); reopen self-heals.
- Transcript-branch → MR mapping (removed as a source on every platform by
  #9739); AGit-Flow SHA heads are therefore moot.
- Any change to manual binding, the sidecar schema, or the bridge/ACP wire
  shapes.

## Risks / open questions

- **Latency**: a large Aone workspace's backfill serializes ≤25 view calls
  (each ≤20s timeout, typically ~1s). The route is a manually-triggered
  maintenance operation; acceptable, documented.
- **`accepted` semantics**: treated as `open` (approved but unmerged). If
  Aone later distinguishes it in the badge, revisit.
- **Closed-state string** was never observed in probes; the mapping is
  defensive (`closed` → `closed`).
- **Cap behavior**: with >25 unique refreshable non-merged bindings, the
  sweep's rotating window covers them in consecutive sweeps (ceil(size/cap));
  within one sweep the window tail degrades like a per-number failure.
  Numbers past the cap also drop out naturally as they merge, so the
  rotation is belt-and-braces rather than the only drain.
