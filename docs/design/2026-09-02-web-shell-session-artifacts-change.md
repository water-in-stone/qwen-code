# Web Shell Session Artifact Snapshots

## Status

This design supersedes the assistant-turn settlement proposal in PR #10398.
Artifact delivery is session state, not assistant-turn settlement. It must not
depend on prompt status, terminal events, transcript repair, or a settlement
ledger.

## Requirements

Embedding hosts need an optional `onSessionArtifactsChange` callback with the
complete Artifact state for the current session. Delivery is eventually
consistent, but an SSE gap or Artifact/transcript arrival order must not hide
an Artifact.

```ts
interface WebShellSessionArtifactsChange {
  reason: 'restore' | 'change';
  sessionId: string;
  sequence: number;
  artifacts: readonly DaemonSessionArtifact[];
  artifactsByTurn: ReadonlyMap<string, readonly DaemonSessionArtifact[]>;
}
```

`restore` is the first hydrated snapshot for a newly entered session after its
transcript is ready, and may be empty. `change` represents an
`artifact_changed` refresh, different same-session reconnect reconciliation,
or later turn-projection change. A real change takes precedence over an
undelivered restore.

`sequence` starts at 1 for each newly entered session. Payloads are complete
replacements, not incremental patches.

## Design

### Artifact hydration and reconciliation

The existing Artifact hook remains the sole snapshot owner. It will:

1. hydrate once for a connected, supported, non-catch-up session;
2. refresh whenever `artifactsVersion` changes;
3. reconcile after reconnect or catch-up;
4. preserve last-good state across a short disconnect;
5. discard stale request generations and session owners; and
6. allow later events or reconnects to recover failed hydration.

Prompt status is not an Artifact trigger. The provider's existing version
counter becomes session-scoped only for Artifact events; its workspace
counters retain their current ownership. No route, event payload, transcript
repair, timer, or settlement state is added.

### Host delivery

A small hook observes the hydrated snapshot and current turn projection. It
keeps a pending reason, delivered signature, per-session sequence, and
observed `artifactsVersion`.

Delivery waits until connected and transcript load/catch-up has ended. The
signature canonically includes every enumerable Artifact field and turn
assignment, including future fields and projection changes.

Live Artifacts are delivered as soon as their hydrated snapshot is ready. If
their turn projection arrives later, the updated full snapshot is delivered
again. This avoids hiding subagent Artifacts whose nested tool event is not
retained in the summary transcript.

Identical snapshots are suppressed. Listener exceptions are reported without
changing built-in Artifact UI state.

### Session ownership

A session-id change resets signature and sequence. Same-id owner replacement
preserves both while stale loads remain guarded by owner/request generation.
Reconnect reconciliation emits `change` only for a different full snapshot.

## Scope

Non-goals are incremental payloads, IDE concepts, Split View aggregation,
live-journal or prompt-settlement changes, new routes or event schemas, and
compatibility wrappers for the unpublished settlement callback.

## Test plan

- **TC-01:** Initial empty and historical sessions deliver `restore`.
- **TC-02:** An initially empty session's first Artifact delivers `change`.
- **TC-03:** An Artifact is delivered before a missing tool-block projection,
  then delivered again when that projection appears.
- **TC-04:** Metadata, projection, and consecutive changes deliver complete
  snapshots; canonical duplicates do not.
- **TC-05:** Reconnect/catch-up finds missed changes without a second restore.
- **TC-06:** Workspace, standalone, and live Artifact events increment the same
  version while other counters remain workspace-scoped.
- **TC-07:** Late loads, failed refreshes, and throwing listeners stay isolated.
- **TC-08:** No prompt/terminal state is used; Artifact rendering remains green.

## Budget and stop conditions

Expected change: about 280 production, 450 test, and 170 documentation lines.
The hard stop is 300 production lines, 900 total additions, or any need to
modify live-journal repair, prompt settlement, daemon routes, or event schemas.
