# Experimental Session Plan & Review

## Goal

Make ordinary-session Workflow visualization opt-in and let users review the
exact Todo dependency graph before execution. Reuse Plan Mode, Todo snapshots,
and the existing permission lifecycle.

## Rollout

`experimental.sessionWorkflow` is disabled by default. When disabled, Core,
the ACP session, and the Web Shell do not create Workflow markers, revision
context, approval gates, or visualization surfaces. Todo updates preserve an
active item's dependencies when `blockedBy` is omitted in every mode; this
shared update behavior is not gated by the setting.

When enabled, the existing `plan` mode is presented as **Plan & Review**. Plan
Mode remains the execution gate: read-only investigation is allowed, mutating
tools remain blocked, rejecting `exit_plan_mode` stays in Plan Mode, and
approving exits Plan Mode.

## Delivery

### Phase 1: opt-in presentation

- Expose the default-off setting through the existing daemon workspace settings
  route.
- Read the effective setting from the Web Shell's active workspace and apply it
  consistently to its main chat, split panes, and side-task panes.
- Keep Todo list rendering unchanged while gating Workflow DAG inputs.
- Rename the existing Plan entry only while the setting is enabled.

### Phase 2: revision-bound approval

- In Plan & Review, require a structured Todo execution snapshot whose nodes
  remain pending before approval.
- Carry the Todo plan identity and source tool-call identity with the
  `exit_plan_mode` approval request.
- Resolve the approval DAG from that identity instead of the latest active
  Todo list.
- Reuse the existing plan ID lineage so later snapshots and Agent executions
  continue updating the same Workflow without another store.
- Mark Todo output only while the experimental setting and Plan/revision
  context are both active. The Web Shell ignores ordinary Todo snapshots.
- After approval, require top-level Agent calls to use a `todo_id` from the
  approved revision. Nested Agents and ordinary sessions keep existing rules.
- Fall back to the existing text-only approval when no matching snapshot is
  available.

### Phase 3: current-session Workflow

- Add Workflow to the existing right-panel tab system. Clicking the floating
  Todo summary or the Session header opens this inspector without replacing
  Chat.
- Reuse the active Todo snapshot, daemon task polling, linked Agent tools, and
  the existing artifact panel instead of introducing another workflow model.
- Keep a matching `exit_plan_mode` approval in Chat. After approval, the user
  can open Workflow for observation at any time.
- Put the progress summary, attention items, ordered steps, selected-step
  context, recent Agent activity, and deliverables in the inspector. Agent and
  artifact links open sibling tabs in the same right-panel controller.
- Keep the dependency graph out of the narrow inspector. An explicit **Expand
  dependency graph** action opens the existing full-page canvas while the
  inspector becomes the selected-node detail surface.
- Keep Chat mounted while either Workflow surface is visible so observation
  does not interrupt execution or discard composer state.
- Let a selected step show its upstream and downstream relationships plus the
  linked Agent's latest activity and runtime metrics. Opening an Agent continues
  into the existing transcript and artifact panel.
- Show Session artifacts from the existing artifact store and keep current
  permission decisions in the existing Chat approval component.
- Keep the Workflow entry available after completion, later chat turns, and
  session resume by reading marked Todo snapshots from the transcript. Opening
  the Session normally restores the entry when a marked snapshot exists.
- Preserve an active Todo's existing dependencies when an update for the same
  ID omits `blockedBy`; an explicit empty array removes dependencies.

## Boundaries

The Workflow remains observational. It does not schedule dependencies, retry
Agents, propagate completion, or add a Workflow store. `blockedBy` and
`todo_id` remain optional for sessions outside Plan & Review. Skill versions
and a durable decision ledger are not claimed because the current transcript
does not provide them.

The standalone cockpit mock remains a product reference rather than a second
application embedded through an iframe. The Web Shell uses a context-preserving
inspector for routine checks and reserves the full-page surface for the DAG.
DataWorks-specific scheduling, retry, and approval queues remain with their
owning product.
