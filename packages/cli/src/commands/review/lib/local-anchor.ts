// The local review-fix loop's anchor: content-addressed per-file state.
//
// A PR round anchors on a commit sha. A local round has none — the reviewed
// state is a dirty working tree, and the local capture path is FORBIDDEN from
// writing to the index, the worktree, or any ref (`local-diff.ts` spells out
// why). So the anchor is content: `git hash-object` — no `-w`, computes and
// writes nothing — over every file the plan covered, plus the HEAD the diff
// was based against. The next round re-hashes the same paths and compares:
// under the same HEAD and the same model, a file whose bytes are identical to
// what the previous clean round reviewed is skipped, one import hop of
// dependents re-enters (same widening, same reasons as `fetch-pr --since`), and the
// rest is the delta.
//
// HEAD equality is a hard gate, not a convenience. The captured diff is
// HEAD-vs-worktree: if HEAD moved between rounds, the same worktree bytes
// describe a DIFFERENT change under review (a reset exposes commits the last
// round never saw), so content equality alone certifies nothing. A moved HEAD
// degrades to the full capture, with the reason said out loud.
