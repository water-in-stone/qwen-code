// `qwen review run`: execute a full /review non-interactively and report the
// verdict in a machine-readable way.
//
// The review pipeline already runs headless — `qwen --prompt "/review …"` expands
// the bundled skill, launches the dimension agents, and honors the approval mode.
// What that path does NOT give a caller is a contract: the verdict lives in the
// model's prose and in files whose names the caller would have to know, the exit
// code says nothing about the review's outcome, and a piped stdin silently
// defeats slash-command detection (the runner prepends piped input, and
// `isSlashCommand` requires the FIRST character to be `/`). Every consumer that
// wants "run a review, tell me what it decided" has been re-deriving those facts
// by scraping a terminal.
//
// This command is that contract, and nothing more: it assembles the /review
// invocation, runs the CLI's own non-interactive path in a child process with
// stdin closed, and then reads the verdict from the artifact `compose-review`
// wrote — the same JSON the skill treats as the verdict authority — rather than
// from anything the model said. Progress streams to stderr; stdout carries only
// the result; the exit code distinguishes "review completed" from "review never
// reached a verdict" from "blocking verdict" (opt-in via --fail-on).

 * issued from a 0.21.3 session had its whole prompt roster built by 0.21.3 —
 * the review ran one version of the skill while its subcommands answered to
 * another, and nothing raised an error.
 *
 * The inherited value is right only when it reaches THIS build (an outer
 * launcher of the same install: the npm bin shim, cli-entry.js, the desktop
 * bundle). The child runs argv[1], so compare the resolved package roots
 * (dirname of realpathSync): cli-entry.js stamps itself but spawns cli.js,
 * so an exact-file comparison would blank a valid same-install stamp. On a

 * stamp this build's own `argv[1]` — the entry this command is about to
