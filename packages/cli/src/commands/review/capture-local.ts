// `qwen review capture-local`: capture the working tree's diff — staged,
// unstaged, and untracked — and partition it into review chunks, in one pass.
// The local counterpart of `fetch-pr`.
//
// This used to be a `git diff` command line typed out in the skill prompt, with
// ten flags to pin and a redirect to dodge Shell model-output truncation. Two things
// were wrong with that. The flags drifted from the ones `fetch-pr` pins (they
// now live in `lib/diff-flags.ts`, shared). And the command it told the model to
// run — `git diff HEAD` — cannot see an untracked file, so every brand-new file
// in the working tree went unreviewed and a working tree whose only change was a
// new file reported "no changes to review".

  // reviews the FIRST capture) AND refuse this round's own incremental
  // scoping, which reads the very same hashes — see `anchorRefusalReason`'s
  // first clause. The cost is a full-range review now and no anchor next
  // round.
  //
  // BOTH endpoints are re-read, the diff and the hashes, because the hash
  // pass sits BETWEEN the two diff snapshots and a write that straddles it
  // is invisible to the diffs alone. Capture B0 → autosave writes B1 → the
  // hashes read B1 → undo restores B0 → the re-capture reads B0: the two
  // diffs agree, and the candidate certifies B1's identity for a round that
  // reviewed B0. The earlier note here had this backwards — it called a
  // same-bytes revert harmless and a different-bytes revert the uncatchable
  // one, when a different-bytes revert moves the endpoints and IS caught,
  // and the same-bytes straddle is what poisons the hashes. "No editor does
  // that by accident" is no answer to an autosave racing an undo.
  //
  // THREE consecutive states, not two, and the two kinds interleaved.
  //
  // Pairwise agreement never tied a capture to the hashes recorded beside
  // it: sampling B0 H0 B1 H1 and asking only "B0 == B1" and "H0 == H1"
  // passes for three phase-aligned writes — X→Y before the hash pass, Y→X
  // before the re-capture, X→Y after it. Both checks hold, `treeHeldStill`
  // is true, and the candidate certifies Y's identity for a round that
  // reviewed X. Promoted, the next round compares cache Y against tree Y,
  // finds no delta and says "No changes" over bytes no round ever read —
  // the exact promise this guard exists to keep.
  //
  // Interleaved sampling does not make that impossible; nothing short of
  // holding the tree still can, and this module cannot. It raises the price
  // from three timed writes to five, and every write has to land in a
  // window bounded by the neighbouring sample of the OTHER kind. The
  // honest description is a tightened sample, not a proof — and every
  // failure of it withholds the candidate, so the cost of being wrong is a
  // full round, never a false certification.
