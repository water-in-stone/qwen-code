// `qwen review fetch-pr`: prepare a PR review's working state in a single
// deterministic pass.
//
//   1. Clean any stale worktree / branch from a previously interrupted run
//      so the new run starts fresh.
//   2. `git fetch <remote> pull/<n>/head:qwen-review/pr-<n>` — pull the PR
//      HEAD into a unique local ref (does not modify the user's working
//      tree, unlike `gh pr checkout`).
//   3. `gh pr view ...` to fetch metadata (head/base ref names, head SHA,
//      diff stats, cross-repo flag).
//   4. `git worktree add` to create an ephemeral worktree at
//      `.qwen/tmp/review-pr-<n>` so subsequent steps can run in isolation.
//   5. Capture the review diff to `.qwen/tmp/qwen-review-pr-<n>-diff.txt` and
//      partition it into chunks. Review agents `read_file` a chunk's line
//      range instead of running `git diff` themselves: Shell keeps a 30 000
//      character persistence trigger but returns an approximately 4 000
//      character head-and-tail model preview, which hides most of a large diff
//      from every agent at once. See `lib/diff-plan.ts`.
//   6. Emit a single JSON report describing the resulting state, which the
//      LLM reads to drive the rest of Step 1.

   * the anchor, rather than the whole merge-base range.
   * `upToDate: true` means nothing has landed since the anchor (the anchor is
   * the head, or the commits since it change no bytes) — a fact about the
   * anchor, proven without consulting the base. The diff and plan then cover
   * the FULL range, because the flows that continue past an up-to-date

   * could not be captured, `diffPath` is null and those flows read the
   * ordinary degraded state, while the flow that stops the round needs no
   * plan at all.
   * `effective: false` carries the reason the anchor was refused, and every
   * reason names a CAUSE: a rebase or force-push (`not-an-ancestor`), a sha
   * this history has never seen (`unknown-commit`), an anchor older than the
   * merge base that would scope WIDER than the PR's diff
   * (`behind-merge-base`), a merge base too stale to rule the clamp on
   * (`base-untrusted`), a capture that threw OR a base-side fault — the
   * base fetch or the merge-base resolution — failed (`capture-failed`), a
   * partitioner that refused to tile (`partition-failed`), or a narrowing
   * that found nothing it could publish (`nothing-to-narrow`). That last one
   * exists because the scope is BUILT from the PR's own diff rather than
   * checked against it, and it covers every shape the build can refuse,
   * deliberately alike: an "undo per feedback" round whose commits put lines
   * back the way the base had them, so the PR no longer displays the undone
   * FILE at all (a file the PR still carries publishes its section whole
   * instead of refusing); a capture on either side whose bytes do not
   * survive UTF-8; a delta the
   * parser cannot read; and the fail-closed refusal — the two captures key
   * the same change differently (a path or a rename git resolves differently
   * across the two ranges), so narrowing would drop a change the PR's diff
   * displays. Every shape keeps the full range: wider, never wrong.
   * On Aone the two ancestry-based reasons (`not-an-ancestor`,
   * `behind-merge-base`) never occur: an AGit-Flow update amends the head
   * in place and orphans the cached sha, so the anchor is ruled WITHOUT
   * ancestry (design D7) and the two heads' diff is read as the update's
   * delta.
   *
   * Whether a PLAN exists is a separate fact, and it is `diffPath`: null
   * means this round has no diff to review, whatever refused the anchor. A
   * reader keys the degraded flow on that, never on the reason — a single
   * field meaning both is what renamed deterministic refusals into the
   * class the skill retries.

 * skip. The hex allowlist comes first so an anchor recovered from a marker
 * or cache is never handed to git as something flag-shaped.
 *
 * `diffBase` is the full sha to scope the diff from, null when the diff must
 * stay full-range (anchor refused, or already at the head).
 *
 * `mergeBase`'s `sha`, when one was resolved, is the clamp: an anchor that is
 * an ancestor of the head but OLDER than the merge base would scope a range
 * strictly
 * WIDER than the PR's own diff (`anchor..head` = the PR plus a slice of base
 * history) — re-reviewing already-landed hunks whose comments fall outside
 * every hunk of GitHub's PR diff, where a single one 422s the whole Create
 * Review call. Reachable non-adversarially: commits from the PR branch
 * landing in the base between rounds move the merge base past the cached
 * anchor. A null `sha` skips the clamp, consistent with the capture path's
 * base-free design — but a `fetchFailed` base that DID resolve a sha refuses
 * the anchor: the clamp would then be ruling on a base resolved from a
 * possibly stale local ref, and every sibling guard here (`isEmptyDiff`,
 * `isCollapsedFromUpstream`) declines to rule in that state rather than
 * ruling on it. `{fetchFailed: true, sha: null}` is not that state — there
 * is no clamp to rule at all, and the delta range needs no base.
 *
 * `noAncestry` is the AGit-Flow rule (Aone; design D7). Under AGit-Flow,
 * updating a CR AMENDS the single commit in place: the amended H2 has H1's
 * parent, never H1 itself, so the old head is orphaned and the
 * anchor-behind-head test fails for EVERY update — the amended head never
 * descends from the cached one. (The clamp additionally fails whenever the
 * update also rebased onto newer master, since the merge base then moves
 * past the cached head; a pure amend passes it.) Neither is asked: after
 * the fetch both heads are local, so `anchor..head` IS the update's delta
 * (for a pure amend, exactly the amended lines; if the author also rebased
 * onto newer master, the range additionally carries the rebase drift; the
 * narrowing join reads it only for which files changed and never lets a
 * drift byte reach the published scope, falling back to the full range via
 * `nothing-to-narrow` when the drift touched files outside the CR's diff).
 * The published scope is still assembled
 * from the PR's own diff by the narrowing step, so it cannot carry a hunk
 * the platform does not display, and the `base-untrusted` refusal stays —
 * it guards a capture against a stale base, not a lineage. The existence
 * checks also stay: an anchor the object store does not hold (a fresh
 * clone) cannot be diffed against.
