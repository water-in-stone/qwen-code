/**
 * `isOwnInterfaceAddress` is reached only through
 * `assertChannelWorkerDaemonUrlIsLocal` and `validateDaemonWorkerUrl`, and in
 * both of those every bracketed literal the suites feed short-circuits on
 * `isLoopbackBind` first (`[::1]` is in `LOOPBACK_BINDS`, and the wildcard
 * binds are rewritten to `127.0.0.1` before the assertion sees them). So the
 * normalisation this function does on the way to `os.networkInterfaces()` —
 * which reports BARE, lowercase addresses and carries the scope separately in
 * `scopeid` — was exercised by nothing, and deleting it shipped green.
 *
 * What a lost normalisation step costs: `qwen serve --hostname <own address>
 * --tls-cert … --channel telegram` binds fine and then refuses its own bind
 * with "does not name an address on this host … Bind to … a literal address of
 * one of this machine's interfaces" — at boot, and again in
 * `validateDaemonWorkerUrl` for every hand-launched worker.
 *
 * Driven off the host's real interfaces rather than a mock: `node:os` is
 * external to the module graph vitest transforms here, so a `vi.mock('node:os')`
 * is visible to this file but NOT to the module under test — a mocked version
 * of this suite passes against a deleted bracket strip. Every address below is
 * one this machine actually answers on, so the assertions hold on an
 * IPv4-only host too.

   * cases that run last here while the earlier ones passed. Intersect the
   * collection snapshot with a fresh read per case, from `node:os` rather than
   * from the function under test so no case can confirm itself, and keep the
   * vacuity guard: the loopback never churns, so this never runs empty.
