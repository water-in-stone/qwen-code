 * signalling the original, and no lease covers the interactive TUI. When
 * both panes sit in the same directory the records flatten to the same
 * name AND the same ref — every address in the grammar (`name`,
 * `name [ref]`, `[ref]`, bare ref) then resolves `ambiguous`,
 * `advertisablePeerAddress` gives up on both, and `list_agents` omits the
 * session while the send error advises a full `name [ref]` that cannot
 * resolve either. The session blacks out until one process exits.
 *
 * Two value-equal peers are not a real choice — they are one session seen
 * twice — so collapsing them is what preserves the grammar. Newest-first
 * matches the registry's own ordering, and is the process a user who just
 * ran `--resume` is looking at.
 *
 * Names are derived from the cwd, so the same session resumed from a
 * different directory (or re-pointed by `/cd`) is a *differently named*
 * incarnation. Those are not collapsed: each bare name still resolves to
 * exactly one process, only the shared `[ref]` is ambiguous, and dropping
 * one would turn a name a peer was just told about into `not-found`.
 *
 * Runs after the probe, over reachable peers only, so a twin whose socket
 * does not answer never shadows the one that does.
