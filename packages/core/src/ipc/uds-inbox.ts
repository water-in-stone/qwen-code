 * session spawns, and is the one fact about a sender the inbox can vouch
 * for: a connection that presents it was opened by something this session
 * itself started. Beyond that, a token authenticates the connection, not
 * the sender: Node cannot read `SO_PEERCRED` without a native addon, so a
 * frame's claimed `from` is still unauthenticated and kept only for reply
 * routing — any process holding a token can write any `from` it likes.
 * Everything downstream is built on that assumption: the inbound gate
 * decides whether a message may act, and the envelope tells the model the
