 * long`, ...), but a reverse proxy in front of an OpenAI-compatible
 * endpoint rejects an oversized serialized request with a bare HTTP 413 —
 * often an HTML error page — that matches no token wording (#10380).
 *
 * Equally important, a 413 must NOT be classified globally as context
 * overflow: upload/file endpoints also legitimately return 413. This
 * detector is therefore only consulted on the model-request path
 * (`llm-chat.ts`'s send catch), never in shared error helpers.
