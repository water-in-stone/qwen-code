# @qwen-code/cua-sdk

Rust-backed TypeScript/Node SDK for Cua Driver client applications.

The package root exposes the complete typed driver SDK. The
`@qwen-code/cua-sdk/computer-use` subpath exposes the smaller high-level API for
application discovery, revision observations, element-token actions, and state
verification. The `@qwen-code/cua-sdk/browser-use` subpath exposes exact browser
binding, semantic page observations, and fixed page actions. All entrypoints
ship in this one npm package.

This Browser Use subpath is an application SDK. Qwen Code's canonical bundled
`browser-use` Skill uses the separate Chrome-extension Browser Use runtime and
does not import this facade.

## Browser Use

Use the Browser facade for supported Chromium-family page content:

```ts
import { BrowserUse } from "@qwen-code/cua-sdk/browser-use"

const browser = await BrowserUse.create()
try {
  const windows = await browser.listWindows({ pid })
  const binding = await browser.bindWindow({
    pid,
    windowId: windows[0].window_id,
  })
  const tabInfo =
    binding.tabs.find((tab) => tab.active === true) ??
    (binding.tabs.length === 1 ? binding.tabs[0] : undefined)
  if (!tabInfo) throw new Error("select an explicit tab")
  const tab = binding.getTab(tabInfo.tabId)
  const state = await tab.observe()
  const clickRef = state.refs.find((ref) => ref.actions.includes("click"))
  if (!clickRef) throw new Error("no clickable ref")
  await tab.click({ ref: clickRef.ref, inputRoute: "dom_event" })
} finally {
  await browser.close()
}
```

The facade does not expose generic Driver dispatch, existing-profile
attachment, file transfer, download, or JavaScript dialog mutation. See
[`browser-use/README.md`](browser-use/README.md) for the supported workflow and
authorization boundary.

## Product boundary

The package root exposes the native SDK:

```ts
import { CuaDriver } from "@qwen-code/cua-sdk"
```

`EmbeddedCuaDriverHost` is exported from both the package root and the
organizational `/embedded` entrypoint; they are the same generated Rust object.
The `/electron` entrypoint is a thin compatibility naming layer over the same
generated macOS permission functions. The package does not contain a TypeScript
MCP client. Agents already have
runtime-neutral MCP clients and should configure the executable directly:

```text
qwen-cua-driver mcp
```

The removed pre-release MCP facade used `CuaDriver.stdio()`, `*Args`
interfaces, and a TypeScript stdio transport. Application code imports the
typed Rust-backed SDK shown below; agent code supplies `qwen-cua-driver mcp` to its
agent SDK.

## SDK example

```ts
import {
  CuaDriver,
  CursorReducedMotion,
  EndSessionInput,
  GetDesktopStateInput,
  SetAgentCursorThemeInput,
  StartSessionInput,
} from "@qwen-code/cua-sdk"

const driver = CuaDriver.create(undefined) // same process; no daemon
await driver.startSession(
  StartSessionInput.new({
    session: "demo",
  }),
)

try {
  await driver.setAgentCursorTheme(
    SetAgentCursorThemeInput.new({
      session: "demo",
      themeId: "cua.default",
      reducedMotion: CursorReducedMotion.Auto,
    }),
  )
  const desktop = await driver.getDesktopState(
    GetDesktopStateInput.new({ session: "demo" }),
  )
  console.log(desktop.images[0]?.mimeType)
} finally {
  await driver.endSession(EndSessionInput.new({ session: "demo" }))
  await driver.shutdown()
  driver.uniffiDestroy()
}
```

SDK operations are asynchronous and require a native library matching the host
OS and architecture. The package postinstall downloads the SDK library and
Node runtime from the exact same-version `qwen-cua-driver` GitHub Release and
verifies the archive against that release's `checksums.txt`. It caches the native library and Node adapter. On Windows it also stages the
UIAccess worker under Program Files and requires a valid trusted signature. It
does not install the driver application or daemon. The
macOS payload requires macOS 13 or newer.
Desktop calls return a typed `ToolResult` with text,
images, verification/error metadata, and `structuredJson` / `rawJson` for
platform-extensible results. Session lifecycle calls return dedicated generated
records.

`startSession` is optional for ordinary calls. The runtime creates one
implicit session for this SDK transport and reuses it until shutdown, explicit
end, or five minutes of inactivity. Use a named session when application code
needs to configure or inspect that run explicitly.

The agent cursor is session-owned and initializes on the first cursor-bearing
action, including `moveCursor`. Its default theme and custom dotLottie
authoring workflow are documented in
[`docs/cursor-themes.md`](../docs/cursor-themes.md). Custom source is compiled
and installed with the local CLI; SDK and MCP tools select only an installed
theme ID. The built-in cursor shows the sanitized public session name in a
badge below the pointer.

## Authorization integrations

`standard` is promptless for normal automation. An application that needs to
authorize attachment to an existing logged-in Chromium profile can construct a
configured runtime with
`CuaDriver.createConfiguredWithAuthorizationHost(options, host)`. Implement
the `DriverAuthorizationHost` interface in trusted application code and return
the request's exact digest with `Allow`, `Deny`, or `Cancel`.

`CuaDriver.createConfiguredWithActivityObserver(options, observer)` emits
content-free action, refusal, grant, and session events. The observer cannot
change authorization or tool results. Use
`createConfiguredWithHostIntegrations` when the application needs both.

See the [embedding guide](../rust/Skills/cua-driver/EMBEDDING.md) for complete
examples and the callback trust rules.

`CuaDriver.connect(socketPath)` remains available while existing applications
migrate. It exposes the same methods over the installed daemon, but it does not
provide a second SDK contract.

`shutdown()` closes admission, waits for already admitted operations to finish,
and is idempotent. Calls started after shutdown reject with `DriverError`.
`uniffiDestroy()` releases the binding handle, but orderly applications should
await `shutdown()` first.

## Daemon-backed MCP hosts

A signed desktop application that must also expose MCP to an external agent can
bundle `qwen-cua-driver`, start it as a direct child, and connect both application
code and its agent runtime to the same private daemon:

```ts
import { CuaDriver, EmbeddedCuaDriverHost } from "@qwen-code/cua-sdk"

const embedded = new EmbeddedCuaDriverHost(
  "/path/inside/YourApp.app/Contents/Resources/qwen-cua-driver",
  "com.example.your-app",
)

try {
  const connection = await embedded.start()
  const driver = CuaDriver.connect(connection.socketPath)
  try {
    // Application calls use driver; an agent runtime uses connection.mcp.
  } finally {
    driver.uniffiDestroy()
  }
} finally {
  await embedded.stop()
  embedded.uniffiDestroy()
}
```

On macOS, the application must spawn the daemon from the process that owns the
Accessibility and Screen Recording grants. Launching through a gateway,
terminal, `open`, or `NSWorkspace` changes the responsibility chain.

Electron main processes can call the permission primitives after
`app.whenReady()`. These functions run in the importing host process, so macOS
attributes their requests to the host rather than to the npm package or child
driver:

```ts
import {
  hasRequiredMacOSPermissions,
  openMacOSScreenRecordingSettings,
  requestMacOSPermissions,
} from "@qwen-code/cua-sdk/electron"

const permissions = requestMacOSPermissions()
if (!hasRequiredMacOSPermissions(permissions) && !permissions.screenRecording) {
  await openMacOSScreenRecordingSettings()
}
```

The adapter does not provide dialogs, settings rows, or onboarding policy. Do
not start the daemon until `hasRequiredMacOSPermissions()` returns true. Stop the
daemon before the host exits. If grants change while it is running, destroy all
SDK clients and MCP proxies, call `embedded.restart()`, and reconnect using the
new connection: every restart changes the generation, PID, and endpoint.

`start()` is concurrency-safe and coalesces callers. `stop()` cancels an
in-progress start and is idempotent. Treat a returned connection as valid only
for its generation, observe unexpected termination with
`waitForExit(connection.generation)`, and stop new work before teardown. The
Rust host also closes a parent-liveness pipe on normal destruction so the daemon
cannot remain orphaned after a host crash.

The npm package is platform-neutral and publishes no platform companion
packages. Set `QWEN_CUA_SDK_NATIVE_DIR` to use a locally built or separately
staged SDK library and Node runtime; release consumers normally need no
override. The package does not install the `qwen-cua-driver` executable: an
application that embeds the daemon must obtain it from the same GitHub Release,
place it outside ASAR, preserve its executable bit, and sign it before signing
and notarizing the enclosing app.

Windows release payloads statically link the Microsoft C runtime, so importing
the SDK on a clean x64 or ARM64 Windows installation does not require a
separate Visual C++ Redistributable installation.

Each release payload also carries Cua's copy-mode build of the pinned UBRN
N-API runtime. Upstream `0.31.0-3` returns Rust-owned memory through
external ArrayBuffers, which Electron 20 and newer intentionally reject because
of V8's memory cage. The copy-mode runtime keeps the generated UniFFI API and
RustBuffer ownership contract unchanged, but copies at the native/JavaScript
boundary before freeing Rust-owned return buffers. Regular Node and Electron
therefore receive the same values; Electron hosts do not need to spawn or
configure the private daemon themselves.
