/**
 * H4b: the first cross-Session dispatcher — the child result relay. It
 * discovers child_agent runs whose delivery line still needs work,
 * drives their idempotent creation, commits the control-plane revisions
 * (dispatch, attach, result, acceptance, the delivered step), and
 * classifies what cannot be proven: a result reaching a closing or
 * closed parent is `orphaned` — recorded, never fed to a model; a fact
 * that stays unproven past its bounded retries is `unknown` — visible,
 * never re-executed. Every step reconciles from what is committed (the
 * parent's record chain, the child Session's rows) and never from its
 * own memory, so a restart of this worker, of the Java instance or of a
 * claim re-runs the same verbs idempotently.
