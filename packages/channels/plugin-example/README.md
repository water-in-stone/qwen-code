# @qwen-code/channel-plugin-example

A reference channel plugin for Qwen Code. It connects to a WebSocket server and routes messages through the full channel pipeline (access control, session routing, agent bridge).

Use this package to:

- **Try out the channel plugin system** — install it as an extension and run it with the built-in mock server
- **Use it as a starting point** — fork the source to build your own channel adapter (see the [Channel Plugin Developer Guide](../../../docs/developers/channel-plugins.md))

## Quick start

### 1. Install the package

```bash
npm install @qwen-code/channel-plugin-example
```

### 2. Link it as a Qwen Code extension

The package ships a `qwen-extension.json` manifest, so it works as an extension out of the box:

```bash
qwen extensions link ./node_modules/@qwen-code/channel-plugin-example
```

### 3. Configure the channel

Add a channel entry to `~/.qwen/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "my-plugin-test": {
      "type": "plugin-example",
      "serverWsUrl": "ws://localhost:9201",
      "senderPolicy": "open",
      "sessionScope": "user",
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/project"
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Start the mock server

```bash
npx qwen-channel-plugin-example-server
```

The server prints the HTTP and WebSocket URLs. You can customize ports with environment variables:

```bash
HTTP_PORT=8080 WS_PORT=8081 npx qwen-channel-plugin-example-server
```

### 5. Start the channel

In a separate terminal:

```bash
qwen channel start my-plugin-test
```

Or run the same adapter under the experimental daemon-managed channel worker:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
qwen serve --channel my-plugin-test
```

`qwen serve --channel` requires the channel's configured `cwd` to resolve to one registered, trusted daemon workspace. In a multi-workspace daemon, named channels are grouped into one worker per owning workspace; `--channel all` still selects only the primary workspace's channels.

### 6. Send a message

```bash
curl -sX POST http://localhost:9200/message \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"senderId":"user1","senderName":"Tester","text":"What is 2+2?"}'
```

You should get a JSON response with the agent's reply.

## How it works

```
Mock Server (HTTP + WS)
  ↕ WebSocket
MockPluginChannel (this package)
  → Envelope → ChannelBase.handleInbound()
    → SenderGate → SessionRouter → ChannelAgentBridge.prompt()
      → qwen-code agent → model API
    ← response
  ← sendMessage() → WebSocket → Mock Server
  ← HTTP response
```

## Building your own channel

See `src/MockPluginChannel.ts` for a working example. The key points:

1. Extend `ChannelBase` and implement `connect()`, `sendMessage()`, `disconnect()`
2. Build an `Envelope` from incoming platform messages and call `this.handleInbound(envelope)`
3. Type the adapter constructor bridge parameter as `ChannelAgentBridge`
4. Export a `plugin` object conforming to `ChannelPlugin`
5. Add a `qwen-extension.json` manifest

`AcpBridge` is still the current standalone `qwen channel start` implementation. Plugin adapters should depend on the `ChannelAgentBridge` abstraction provided by `@qwen-code/channel-base`.

Existing TypeScript plugins that explicitly type the adapter constructor or factory `bridge` parameter as `AcpBridge` should change that annotation to `ChannelAgentBridge`. JavaScript plugins are unaffected at runtime.

`qwen serve --channel <name>` hosts the same plugin through a daemon-managed worker backed by `DaemonChannelBridge`. The worker is owned by `qwen serve`; stop the daemon to stop serve-managed channels.

### Features you get for free

- **Block streaming** — enable `blockStreaming: "on"` in config and the agent's response is automatically split into multiple messages at paragraph boundaries
- **Attachments** — populate `envelope.attachments` with images/files and `handleInbound()` routes them to the agent (images as vision input, files as paths in the prompt)
- **Streaming hooks** — override `onResponseChunk()` for progressive display (e.g., editing a message in-place)
- Access control (allowlist, pairing, open), session routing, slash commands, crash recovery

Daemon-managed named tasks attach an optional delivery-only `sourceLabel` to output-segment contexts and thread delivery. A streaming adapter must render it on the first independently visible chunk of each segment and on a separately visible final response. Keep the raw model text unchanged, parse sentinels or media markers before adding the label, escape the label for the platform's markup dialect, and reserve room for it when splitting platform-sized messages. The example adapter demonstrates this contract without persisting the label in its WebSocket protocol state.

## Lifecycle status

The mock plugin protocol exposes streamed chunks and final outbound messages only. It does not model typing indicators, reactions, card updates, or any other status surface, so prompt and task lifecycle status are intentionally no-op for this example channel.
