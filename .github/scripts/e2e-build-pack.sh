# Pack one E2E build for every leg of e2e.yml to unpack.
#
# Each leg used to run `npm run build` and `npm run bundle` itself: 4–8
# minutes on a hosted VM, 10–17 on a busy pool host, eleven times per run.
# The outputs are platform-independent JavaScript, so the `build` job runs
# this once and uploads the archive; e2e-build-unpack.sh restores it.
#
# The archive holds the bundle (dist/), every workspace dist/ the tests or
# the bundle resolve through node_modules symlinks, and a stamp of the commit
# it was built from so a leg can refuse a tree from another commit. tar keeps
# file modes, which the artifact store does not.
#
# Usage: e2e-build-pack.sh <archive-path>
# Run from the repository root after build and bundle. GITHUB_SHA must be set.
