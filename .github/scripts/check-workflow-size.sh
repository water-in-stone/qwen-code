# The gate above is the ceiling; the baseline below is the RATCHET. The gate

# invisibly until one unlucky PR has to pay for everyone: qwen-autofix.yml
# regained 78 KB when its prose moved out (#9517) and gave 25 KB of it back in
# a single feature commit two days later, unremarked. Each file's recorded size
# lives in .size-baseline; exceeding it by more than the allowance fails until
# the number is updated in the same PR, which turns the drift into one line a
# reviewer sees.

# The ratchet compares the worktree against a checked-in baseline, so a
# workflow that grew on main without the same-PR baseline bump leaves every
# OTHER open PR failing a gate on a file it never touched (red-walled the
# queue twice in two weeks: #9747, #9822). When the caller passes the PR's
# base commit in WORKFLOW_SIZE_BASE_SHA, the missing-entry and growth
# branches below hard-fail only if the PR actually changed the file; a
# byte-identical copy means the staleness is main-side drift and earns a
# warning instead. An unresolvable base (local run, fetch failure) falls
# back to the strict failure — the ratchet fails closed, never open. One
# residual window stays by design: if main edits the same workflow again
# after the PR branched, the comparison against the new base sees the PR's
# older copy as different and fails closed until that PR rebases —
# self-healing, and still fail-closed, so it is left alone rather than
# wiring the PR's changed-files list into a gate that today needs no API
